      "Alternate fast dough method: if you need the pizza dough faster, you can add 1 tsp of yeast instead of 1/2 and leave it out on the counter to rise rather than in the fridge. Once it has doubled in volume it is ready to use. It should take 2-3 hours at room temperature.",
      "To make the pizza set your oven to 500 F. Lightly grease a cookie sheet with olive oil.",

Add the rest and mix again, then quickly and confidently bring the dough together into a ball. It does not need to be perfect, just make sure the dough all comes together into a lump without excess flour everywhere. Use a few more drops of water if you need to. Sometimes a drier climate can change the amount you need. Once it has come together quickly shape it into a disc and take your hands off it. Cover it with plastic wrap or a moist towel and place it in the fridge for 20 minutes.",

Now roll it out with a rolling pin, gently press the rolling pin down and straight in front of you to flatten it. Once you have rolled it out a few times, turn it 90 degrees and flip it over and roll again. If it is sticking to the surface you are rolling on, sprinkle some more flour underneath it and on top. Continue with the rolling, turning it 90 degrees and flipping it technique until it is rolled out to about 10-12 inches in diameter.",

      "Bake the crostata on the lowest shelf for 35 minutes. By placing it on the lower shelf you can get the bottom of the crust as crisp as possible, since it can end up soggy with all the juices seeping into it.",

Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough, about \u00bc\u201d thick. Punch out as many 3\u201d to 4\u201d dough\r\ncircles as possible, using a round cookie cutter or a drinking glass.

Melt a tablespoon of butter in a pan on medium heat, then fry up as many perogies as you want. (Six per person is plenty, these are really rich and filling.) Flip them every few minutes until they\u2019re browned on all sides. Serve with scallions and a dollop of sour cream."

Cook for 1 1/2 to 3 hours, until the chickpeas are soft and cooked through. To lessen the simmering time, you can soak the chickpeas in water overnight, which can cut down on cooking time by an hour or more.

It does not need to be perfect, just make sure the dough all comes together into a lump without excess flour everywhere. Use a few more drops of water if you need to. Sometimes a drier climate can change the amount you need. Once it has come together, quickly shape it into a disc and take your hands off it. Cover it with plastic wrap or a moist towel and place it in the fridge for 20 minutes.",

Once you have rolled it out a few times, turn it 90 degrees and flip it over and roll again. If it is sticking to the surface you are rolling on, sprinkle some more flour underneath it and on top. Continue with the rolling, turning it 90 degrees and flipping it technique until it is rolled out to about 10-12 inches in diameter.",
      "Transfer the rolled out dough to a 9-inch pie plate, pressing it into the bottom and letting any excess dough hang down the sides. You want about 1/2 inch of excess pastry hanging all the way around the rim. Trim away any pieces that are longer. Use your fingers in a pinching motion to roll excess dough up to create an edge on the lip of the pie plate. Squish this down with your fingers or a fork to create a rim around the lip of the pie. Alternatively, use a pinching motion to crimp the edge. If you are a bit mystified by this process check out this pie crimping video tutorial by my friend, Nicki Sizemore.",
      "Refrigerate the pie dough in the pie plate and set the oven to 375 F. Once the oven is ready you are going to blind-bake the crust. We need to partially cook it because our filling will take less time to cook than the pastry, so we want to give it a head start.",

Place the pork shoulder in a large pot with a tight lid or a Dutch oven. Cover with a towel or lid and leave in the fridge for a few hours or overnight.",
      "Pour enough water into the pot to cover the bottom. This will keep the juices from burning. Put the lid on and place the pot in a 200 F oven for 10 to 12 hours. I find it's easier if I cook the pork overnight and pull it out in the morning, but you can put it in early in the morning and have it ready for dinner as well.",
      "The supposed rule is that cooking takes 1.5 to 2 hours per pound of pork, but I find it usually takes a little longer than that. You are waiting for the internal temperature to reach 200 F. The meat is edible at 160 F, but at higher temperatures the tough connective tissues break down to create the flavor and texture that make pulled pork a delicious and unique treat.",
      "If you don't have a meat thermometer, figuring out the internal temperature is obviously difficult, but you can test it by feel. Poke the meat with a finger: when it's so soft that it falls apart on its own, take it out of the oven.",
      "To pull the meat, remove it from the juices and gently tear the pork apart with two forks or with your hands. Discard any larger bits of fat that you don't wish to eat. If any section is hard to tear apart, the meat hasn't cooked enough to break down the connective tissue. If you have the time to spare, put it back in the oven for another couple of hours.",
      "Once you've pulled all of the pork, mix in any remaining rub and move it to a casserole dish or a large plate. If you aren't eating the meat right away, stash it in the fridge.",
      "Optionally, if you want to make a sauce from the pot full of drippings, bring it to a gentle boil on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Let the juices thicken for 20 to 30 minutes. The fat will rise to the top: it's the clear, thick layer, not the thin, red liquid below. Skim off as much of the fat as possible. Mix a few spoonfuls of the pan drippings with the pork before serving.",
      "Feel free to add a little barbecue sauce to the pork if it isn't flavorful enough for you, but try it first, I think you'll be surprised!"

Knead the dough for a minute, then cover it with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rest for 30 minutes to 2 hours.",
      "Choose one filling or the other. Mix all the filling ingredients in a large bowl.",

      "Cut the log into 15 equal slices, then use your hands to form one of the slices into a flat disc. With a rolling pin, flatten the disc into an almost paper-thin circle about the size of a drink coaster.",
      "Place a heaping tablespoon of filling in the center of the dough. Lift all the edges to meet in the middle, then pinch it closed like a little parcel. If the dough won\u2019t stick to itself, wet your fingertips and dab the edges.",
      "Repeat until you run out of either filling or dough. This is a great time to ask for help from family or friends\u2014one person rolling while others fill and cook.",
      "Now, a tough decision: do you want to steam, fry, or boil your dumplings?",
      "To steam them, spread a small amount of oil around a large pan. Fill the pan with dumplings\u2014as many as you can fit without them sticking to each other. Turn the heat to medium and let them sizzle for about a minute. Once the dough has absorbed most of the oil, add about \u00bd cup of water to the pan, then quickly cover with a lid. The water will splatter and sizzle loudly. Leave the lid on for about a minute to steam the dumplings, then turn the heat down to low and remove the lid. Let it keep cooking until the water evaporates, then turn off\r\nthe heat. Your dumplings should be steamed on top with crispy, brown bottoms.",
      "To pan-fry them instead, start following the technique above, but use more oil. Skip the water and the lid  entirely. Just keep frying! Once the dumplings are golden on one side, flip them to fry the other side. This method is awkward with parcel-style dumplings but works well for other shapes, so plan accordingly.",
      "Alternatively, boil the dumplings by dropping them into a pot of boiling water. When they rise to the top, they\u2019re ready to eat, usually in 1 or 2 minutes."

Crack as many eggs into the pan as you can fit and sprinkle each with a little salt and pepper. My pan could do 4, but I did 3 at a time so I could do it in even batches. Cook the eggs to your preferences, sunny-side up or medium or whatever. I like my eggs over easy. To get over easy eggs, cook the eggs until the whites are no longer clear, but the yolks are very runny, usually 1 minute to 1.5 minutes. Quickly and gently flip them over, leave for about 10 seconds and then turn off the heat. This method ensures that the yolk is fully cooked, but the yolk remains runny when you poke it with a fork.

      "As quickly as you can, add the butter curls into the bowl with the flour and mix it up just a bit with your fingers, covering the frozen butter with flour. Working quickly, pour the quarter cup of water into the bowl and use your fingers to bring the dough together roughly. Work as quickly as you can mixing it, but try not to break up the butter too much. You want to have bits of butter popping throughout the pastry \u2014 that\u2019s what creates flakiness. If it's still just too dry add another Tbsp of water.",
      "Finally, dump the rough dough out onto a clean countertop and bring it together into a rough disc shape with your hands. Cover it tightly with plastic wrap and leave in the fridge for an hour or overnight if you are making it the next day.",
      "After an hour, remove the dough from your fridge and let it rest on the counter for 5 minutes so you can roll it our more easily.",

      "Sprinkle a clean counter liberally with flour. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough straight in front of you. Once you have rolled a couple of times, pick up the dough and flip it over. Then rotate the dough 90 degrees. Roll out the dough another couple of times. Flipping it and rotating it will keep it from sticking to the countertop and help you make an even circle. Sprinkle more flour onto the counter if anything gets sticky. Don\u2019t be shy with the flour! Repeat this process until you have a large enough circle of dough to fit your pie dish (I use a 9 inch dish here), with some excess. You want to have pastry that is hanging over the edge of the pie plate, because it helps create a nice edge and lets you fix any mistakes you make.",
      "Transfer the dough to a 9 inch pie dish and press it gently in place. You want about an inch of excess pastry hanging all the way around the rim. Trim away any pieces that are longer. Use your fingers in a pinching motion to roll excess dough up to create an edge on the lip of the pie plate. Squish this down with your fingers or a fork to create a rim around the lip of the pie. Alternatively, use a pinching motion to crimp the edge. If you are a but mystified by this process just do a google search and you can find lots of tutorials on youtube!",
      "Refrigerate the pie dough while you make the filling.",
      "To make the filling add the eggs to a bowl and whisk quickly to break up the yolks. Next add the pumpkin puree and sugar and whisk again. Add the salt, zest and all the spices and whisk again. Finally add the whipped cream and slowly and carefully whisk it into the thicker mixture. You only need to be careful here so you don't splash cream on yourself. Once the filling is smooth and even you're done!",
      "Take the prepared pie crust out of the fridge and gently pour the filling into the crust.",
      "Carefully place the pie in the oven and bake for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes check the pie. If it is still wiggly and wet in the middle leave it for another 5 to 15 minutes. I find it needs 50 minutes to an hour total, but some ovens are crazy so check it at 45 just in case. If you aren't sure if it's too wet, remove it from the oven and test with a toothpick or knife, if it comes out mostly dry (you may get moisture on it, but no clumps\u2014it's a custard pie after all, you do want some moisture!) it's ready.",
      "Once the filling is no longer jiggly, pull it out of the oven and let it cool to room temperature (this usually takes 1 to 2 hours).",
      "Once the pie is cool prepare the whipped cream. In a large bowl or stand mixer add the whipping cream, sugar and zest or cinnamon. Whip it with a whisk, or electric mixer until soft peaks form. Taste the cream and if you think it needs a little more sugar, zest or cinnamon add it now. Whip it a few more times until it's a consistency where if you drop it off the spoon it stays fairly well in place rather than oozing out.",
      "Spread the whipped cream over the top of the cooled pie in a nice even layer, or in dollops, whatever way you like. Sprinkle with more cinnamon or orange zest if you like. Serve immediately or leave in the fridge until ready to serve."

      "Once the apple cider has boiled for 30 minutes, remove it from the heat. The amount of liquid should have reduced by more than half and the apple should be soft. Blend the mixture in a food processor or with a handheld blender. Pour the pureed mixture into a measuring cup. It should measure approximately 1 cup. If there is too much, pour the mixture back into the pot and let it cook for a few more minutes until it has reduced to about a cup of liquid. If it is less than a cup add a bit more apple cider until it reaches a cup.",

Mix for 1 to 2 minutes. It should be very smooth with a little of the dough sticking to the bottom of the pan.",

Add the eggs one at a time, making sure each egg is thoroughly mixed before you add the next egg. At first the dough will separate, but don't panic, it will come back together as you add more eggs. Once all the eggs are added, the dough should be smooth, glossy and light. Add the other half apple worth of apple pieces and gently stir them into the dough until they are just incorporated.",
      "Quickly spoon out the dough onto your prepared baking sheets. They might look a little messy, but that's okay. Leave about an inch between each spoonful of dough. Pop them into the oven and set the timer for 20 minutes. You will probably not fit them all in at once so leave the dough on the counter covered with a tea towel between batches.",
      "Prepare the glaze by simply whisking the ingredients together in a medium sized bowl.",
      "Check the puffs after 20 minutes to see if they are evenly golden brown. Sometimes they require a few more minutes so don't be afraid to leave them in a little longer, up to 25 minutes.",

      "While the brine simmers, fill the jars with the cucumbers. You will add approximately 1 lb of cucumbers to each jar but sometimes it may be a little less or more. Just fit in as much as you can. If you like, add a few pieces of red onion or shallot, cloves of garlic or sprigs of dill to the jars. They add a bit more flavor and then you get some pickled onions or garlic as well! But these are totally optional.",
      "Once the brine has simmered for 10 minutes (be sure to put your kitchen fan on during this process as the vinegar smell can get intense and make you cough otherwise) pour the brine over the vegetables in the jars. Fill them up to the brim. It's hard to get this amount just right so you may have some leftover or occasionally you may not have enough. If you don't have enough just boil up another cup of water and vinegar along with a Tbsp of salt and use that to top everything up.",
      "Once the brine has cooled to room temperature place the lids on the jars and seal them. Leave the pickles in the fridge for 2 weeks. Once 2 weeks is up open and enjoy!"

      "1 5.4 oz can coconut cream ((unsweetened))",
      "2 Tbsp honey",
      "1/2 tsp vanilla",
      "2  mangos"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
      "To make the coconut cream open your can of coconut cream. Place a large sieve over a bowl and use a spoon to scoop the coconut cream into the sieve letting the thin, coconut milk fall through the sieve and settle in the bowl. The coconut milk will have settled on the bottom of the can and this is the simplest way to separate the cream from the milk. We just want the cream for this recipe! Alternatively you can just carefully scoop out your cream, making sure the milk doesn't mix in with the cream.",
      "In a bowl add the coconut cream, honey and vanilla and whisk for 30 seconds or so until it is smooth and thick.",
      "Now cut up the mangoes. Here's some detailed instructions below, but if you already know how to cut mangoes just skip to the end.",
      "Get a sharp paring knife and a cutting board. Hopefully you have a ripe mango. You want it to have just a little give everywhere. Firm, but your fingers can still easily squish it a bit. If it has any super squishy bits then it is probably bruised or over-ripe so try to pick the ones that have pretty much the same firmness, with just a little give all over. A good mango should feel a lot like a ripe avocado if you are more used to choosing them.",
      "There is a large pit in the centre that is very long, but not very wide so you don't want to cut through the middle like you would with a peach. Holding the mango at the tip, with the wider rounded parts facing out, cut one slice of the mango off, kind of like you are cutting a cheek off. See where I did it below. Now slice all the way down.",
      "Now repeat on the other side. You'll end up with 3 pieces of mango: 2 \"cheek\" pieces that are all the delicious flesh and one flat piece with a big pit in the middle.",
      "The pitted piece is the one on the bottom of the photo. See the white, slightly hairy bits peaking out? That is the pit!",
      "The piece with the pit on it still has some delicious mango flesh on it and we want all of it. So peel the skin off it, losing as little of the flesh as you can. Don't use my technique here. It's terrible. This is the only way I could show you what I was doing with one hand. Looks pretty ridiculous!",
      "Once you have it peeled, cut away at the flesh, using the pairing knife to feel when you get too close to the tough pit. Just cut off small hunks and don't worry about them looking pretty. Get as much off as you can. The riper it is the more mango you can cut away from the pit. You may find your hands getting juicy and slippery so be careful. But better to get into it and wait until the end to clean your hands because there is a lot more to come.",
      "There ya go! Now, don't throw out the pit, you'll use it later.",
      "Now take one of the \"cheek\" pieces and make 4-5 vertical cuts all the way down. Do not slice through the peel, just slice through the mango flesh until you feel the peel. If you go a bit too far don't worry, it will be fine, but try not to cut through the peel. It should look like this when you are done.",
      "Now cut horizontally using the same technique to make a little checkerboard with your mango.",
      "Now, gently press on the outer layer of peel upward to turn the piece inside out and kind of pop the mango pieces out. This is a lovely way to serve mango so if you are cutting mango just to eat or to serve someone else in the future, just stop here! But we're not quite done for our parfait.",
      "Now do the same with the other side and then gently slice off the little squares with your knife, getting as close to the peel as you can. Look at your nice little pile of mango! Now do it again with the 2nd mango! It gets pretty quick and a lot easier with practice, I swear!",
      "Now, as the mango slicer, take your reward and bite off any leftover mango bits from the pit piece.",
      "Mmmmm this is so good. Do I even need to make the rest of the recipe?",
      "Gotta gnaw off every bit of the mango flesh!  Don't worry if it gets stuck in your teeth. You'll get it out ... eventually.",
      "Okay, so now just take your mango and spoon a layer of it into each glass. Top it with some coconut cream and then add the rest of the mango. Then drizzle the rest of the coconut cream overtop aaaaaand you're done! Not much to this one, but it is soooooo delicious and quite rich from the coconut cream. Now pick someone you really love to share this with and enjoy!"

      "If you are making the frosting, use an electric mixer to beat the cream cheese, butter, sugar, and cinnamon together until light and fluffy. It should take 5 to 7 minutes. Once the rolls are room temperature, slather them with frosting and enjoy!"

    "recipeInstructions": [
      "Cut the stick of butter into small chunks, approximately 8 to 12 pieces. Set them in a small bowl in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes.",
      "While the butter chills, add the flour and salt to your food processor.",
      "Add the butter to the flour mixture in the food processor. Pulse the mixture 3 to 4 times until the butter pieces are chopped up into bean sized chunks.",
      "Add 4 tablespoons of water and pulse again. Add water a tablespoon at a time, pulsing as little as possible in between until the mixture looks like it is just able to come together. It should be very shaggy and chunky. You want to have bits of butter popping throughout the pastry\u2014that's what creates flakiness.",
      "Dump the mixture out onto a clean countertop and bring it together into a rough disc shape using your hands. Cover it with plastic wrap and leave it in the fridge for an hour.",
      "After an hour, remove the dough from the fridge and let it rest on the counter for 5 minutes so you can roll it out more easily.",
      "Set the oven to 425 degrees F.",
      "Sprinkle a clean counter liberally with flour. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough straight in front of you. Once you have rolled a couple of times, pick up the dough and flip it over. Then rotate the dough 90 degrees. Roll out the dough another couple of times. Flipping it and rotating it will keep it from sticking to the countertop and help you make an even circle. Sprinkle more flour onto the counter if anything gets sticky. Don't be shy with the flour! Repeat this process until you have a large enough circle of dough to fit your pie plate, with some excess. You want to have pastry that is hanging over the edge of the pie plate, because it helps create a nice edge and lets you fix any mistakes you make.",
      "Transfer the dough to a 9 inch pie plate and press it gently in place. You want about an inch of excess pastry hanging all the way around the rim. Trim away any pieces that are longer. Use your fingers in a pinching motion to roll excess dough up to create an edge on the lip of the pie plate. Squish this down with your fingers or a fork to create a rim around the lip of the pie. Alternatively, use a pinching motion to crimp the edge.",
      "Prick the pie dough all over with a fork\u2014this lets the air out while it bakes and helps to keep it from shrinking too much. Now cover the whole pastry with aluminum foil, pressing all around to cover the edges as well. Now pour dried beans (or some people use pennies) into the aluminum foil covered crust. These will weight the crust down and allow it to cook evenly without puffing up and shrinking.",
      "Bake the crust with the dried beans for 15 minutes. This is called blind-baking. It's a useful method when pie filling has a shorter cooking time than the crust, as is the case here.",
      "While the crust bakes, add all the ingredients for the filling to a large bowl and whisk it together until it is smooth and homogenous, being particularly careful to blend the eggs fully into the mixture.",
      "Remove the blind-baked crust from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before removing the pie weights. Turn the oven temperature down to 400 F. Remove the aluminum foil carefully and prick the crust all over with a fork again.",
      "Whisk the egg yolk in a small bowl. Use a pastry brush to gently brush the yolk all over the par-baked crust. Bake the crust for 5 more minutes. This step creates a moisture barrier between the crust and the pie filling, further ensuring that your crust will be crisp, even on the bottom of the pie.",
      "After 5 minutes, pull the crust out of the oven and pour in the pie filling. Very carefully place the pie back in the oven and bake for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes check to see if the center is still jiggly by gently shaking the pie back and forth. If it doesn't move too much in the middle it's ready, if it still jiggles, give it up to 15 more minutes in the oven.",
      "Once the filling is no longer jiggly, pull it out of the oven and let it cool to room temperature. Once it's cool enough, transfer it to the fridge to chill for 2 hours or overnight.",
      "15 minutes before serving, add the cream, sugar and cinnamon to a bowl and whisk until stiff peaks form.",
      "Slice the pie into pieces and serve with a dollop of cinnamon-whipped cream on top. Enjoy your hard work!"

While the croutons are still hot, sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Set aside.",

If some of the spine is left in it's not a problem, but it is tough, so you want to get rid of most of it without sacrificing your tasty leaves. Slice the leaves in half lengthwise, then cut into thin ribbons. Cutting the leaves into thin ribbons will disguise its naturally tough texture. Add the kale to the bowl and toss to coat it with the dressing. Set aside for 10 minutes or leave in the fridge for a few hours. The kale will become more tender if it marinates in the dressing for a while.",

Add a bit of salt to the pan, turn down the heat and add about 1/4 cup water to get some of the brown stuff off the bottom of the pan. Keep cooking, stirring occasionally until the shallots are a deep brown. Add water as needed to unstick the pan.",

      "Place your cookie sheet with green beans under the broiler. Watch it carefully. You want the green beans to soften and cook and the coconut to get nicely browned, but not burnt. Use an oven mitt and occasionally move the cookie sheet to make sure that the beans and coconut are getting evenly toasted. It will be fast! It took my broiler about 2 minutes to cook the beans and toast the coconut.",
