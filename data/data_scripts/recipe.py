Add the olive oil.", "If you have a stand mixer, use the flat beater to combine everything, including the water. Once it comes together, switch to the dough hook and knead for 5 to 7 minutes.", "f you're using your hands, mix the oil into the dough, crumbling it into the flour until it's sandy in texture. Add the cold water. Mix until it just comes together. Then knead the dough for five to seven minutes. Keep a cup of ice-cold water beside you. When your hand gets too warm, dip it in the water.", "The dough will be smooth but quite wet once you (or the mixer) finish kneading it. It should stick to the bottom of the bowl but not the sides.", "When the dough is ready, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and put it in the fridge.", "The next day, remove the dough from the fridge two to three hours before you want to make your pizza. Keep the dough covered in plastic wrap or a moist dishcloth, because it'll develop a gross skin if it's exposed to air.", "Alternate fast dough method: if you need the pizza dough faster, you can add 1 tsp of yeast instead of 1/2 and leave it out on the counter to rise rather than in the fridge. Once it has doubled in volume it is ready to use. It should take 2-3 hours at room temperature.", "To make the pizza set your oven to 500 F. Lightly grease a cookie sheet with olive oil.", "Cut or break off the tough bottom ends of the asparagus. Take a vegetable peeler and peel the asparagus from root to tip to create fine ribbons of asparagus.", "Sprinkle with salt and pepper and set aside.", "Once the oven is hot, take your dough and gently begin to stretch it out on a well floured countertop. Using your fingertips, press it out (or use a rolling pin) until it is the same size and shape (or close enough) as your cookie sheet. Place the crust on the pan.", "Sprinkle the ricotta all over the crust. Top with the ribbons of asparagus, salt and pepper, and drizzle with a little olive oil and a sprinkling of freshly grated Romano.", "Bake in the oven for 8 minutes or until the crust is lightly brown on the edges.", "Take the pizza out of the oven and squeeze a little lemon juice and sprinkle a bit more romano.

Whisk it together to form a dressing.", "Cut the avocado in half and remove the core with your knife. Using a pairing knife make 5 or 6 long incisions in the avocado all the way from top to bottom, running the knife through the flesh of the avocado until you hit the skin. Then do the same incision 6 to 8 times horizontally. You should now have a criss-cross pattern on your avocado. Now use a spoon to scoop the avocado flesh from the skin. As you remove the flesh it will fall away into little square pieces. It\u2019s a lot like cutting a mango", "Add the avocado pieces, black beans, a healthy pinch of salt and the noodles you made earlier to the bowl and toss gently to coat. If your avocado is really ripe you will squish the avocado a bit as you toss the salad and it will become kind of like guacamole noodles.
