COPY public.instruction (id, text, recipe_id) FROM stdin;
1	This recipe is extremely loose. Basically, just stir some of your favorite chopped vegetables into yogurt and add salt and pepper. Use this as a stepping stone to develop your own.	1
2	After you stir all the ingredients together, store the raita in a covered container in the fridge until you’re ready to use it.	1
3	To make the dough, dump the flour, salt, and yeast into a big bowl. Add the olive oil.	2
4	If you have a stand mixer, use the flat beater to combine everything, including the water. Once it comes together, switch to the dough hook and knead for 5 to 7 minutes.	2
5	f you're using your hands, mix the oil into the dough, crumbling it into the flour until it's sandy in texture. Add the cold water. Mix until it just comes together. Then knead the dough for five to seven minutes. Keep a cup of ice-cold water beside you. When your hand gets too warm, dip it in the water.	2
6	The dough will be smooth but quite wet once you (or the mixer) finish kneading it. It should stick to the bottom of the bowl but not the sides.	2
7	When the dough is ready, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and put it in the fridge.	2
8	The next day, remove the dough from the fridge two to three hours before you want to make your pizza. Keep the dough covered in plastic wrap or a moist dishcloth, because it'll develop a gross skin if it's exposed to air.	2
9	Alternate fast dough method: if you need the pizza dough faster, you can add 1 tsp of yeast instead of 1/2 and leave it out on the counter to rise rather than in the fridge. Once it has doubled in volume it is ready to use. It should take 2-3 hours at room temperature.	2
10	To make the pizza set your oven to 500 F. Lightly grease a cookie sheet with olive oil.	2
11	Cut or break off the tough bottom ends of the asparagus. Take a vegetable peeler and peel the asparagus from root to tip to create fine ribbons of asparagus.	2
12	Sprinkle with salt and pepper and set aside.	2
13	Once the oven is hot, take your dough and gently begin to stretch it out on a well floured countertop. Using your fingertips, press it out (or use a rolling pin) until it is the same size and shape (or close enough) as your cookie sheet. Place the crust on the pan.	2
14	Sprinkle the ricotta all over the crust. Top with the ribbons of asparagus, salt and pepper, and drizzle with a little olive oil and a sprinkling of freshly grated Romano.	2
15	Bake in the oven for 8 minutes or until the crust is lightly brown on the edges.	2
16	Take the pizza out of the oven and squeeze a little lemon juice and sprinkle a bit more romano. Cut into rectangles and serve hot.	2
17	In a large mixing bowl, add the lime juice, hot sauce and olive oil. Whisk it together to form a dressing.	3
18	Cut the avocado in half and remove the core with your knife. Using a pairing knife make 5 or 6 long incisions in the avocado all the way from top to bottom, running the knife through the flesh of the avocado until you hit the skin. Then do the same incision 6 to 8 times horizontally. You should now have a criss-cross pattern on your avocado. Now use a spoon to scoop the avocado flesh from the skin. As you remove the flesh it will fall away into little square pieces. It’s a lot like cutting a mango	3
19	Add the avocado pieces, black beans, a healthy pinch of salt and the noodles you made earlier to the bowl and toss gently to coat. If your avocado is really ripe you will squish the avocado a bit as you toss the salad and it will become kind of like guacamole noodles. Taste and add more salt or lime juice if you like.	3
20	Toss all the ingredients in a blender and whizz them up! Let it go for a while because the avocados need to break down and blend with the milk. Once the liquid is Kermit the Frog green, it’s ready. Taste it and add more sugar or lime juice as needed.	4
21	Cut the avocado in half and remove the core with your knife. Using a pairing knife make 5 or 6 long incisions in the avocado all the way from top to bottom, running the knife through the flesh of the avocado until you hit the skin. Then do the same incision 6 to 8 times horizontally. You should now have a criss-cross pattern on your avocado. Now use a spoon to scoop the avocado flesh from the skin. As you remove the flesh it will fall away into little square pieces.	5
22	Cut the grapefruit in half along its equator. Place each half flat side down on your cutting board. Cut off the top peel of one half and then carefully cut the peel away along with as much of the white pith as you can, following the contours of the round fruit so you don't accidentally cut away too much fruit. Once you've cut away all the peel, slice in half again through the centre removing any white pith in the centre and any seeds. Cut each quarter into approximately 6 small wedges. Repeat with 2nd half of grapefruit.	5
23	In a mixing bowl add the avocado, grapefruit, white beans, and scallions if using and mix to combine. Sprinkle 1/4 tsp salt, mix and then taste. Add another 1/4 tsp or more according to your taste.	5
24	Toast your bread or naan bread or flat bread until crispy and brown.	5
25	Top your toasts generously with the avocado salad and eat with your hands or a knife and fork.	5
26	In a small pot, add the oats, water, salt, cinnamon, orange zest and 2 Tbsp of the honey. Place it on medium-high heat, just until the water comes to a boil.	6
28	Once it’s cooked, top each bowl with another tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of nuts.	6
29	Remove the pits from the dates and place them in a bowl. Cover them with 1/2 cup of water and leave for 10 minutes to overnight. The longer you leave them to soak the easier they will be to blend. If you have a high powered blender you can skip this step.	7
30	Add the dates and water to a blender or food processor and blend for two minutes until you have a smooth, milky looking mixture. A few small chunks are okay!	7
31	Add the banana and vanilla and blend until smooth. Pour into a glass and enjoy!	7
27	Immediately turn the heat to low and place a lid on the pot. Cook for 5 minutes, until the oats are soft and tender and most of the water has cooked off. You can add more water if you like your oatmeal smooth and thin, or use slightly less if you want a thick oatmeal.	44
645	Heat oven to 350 F. Butter or oil a 9” x 13” pan.	102
32	In a medium bowl, add the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, soda and salt. Mix thoroughly with a spoon.	8
33	In another bowl, add the mashed bananas (or just mash them in the bowl), eggs, milk, and vanilla, then mix. Add the dry mixture from the other bowl into the second bowl. Gently stir it with a spoon until everything just comes together. Tender pancakes come from not over-mixing the batter. If there are still a few pockets of flour, don't worry about it. Let the mixture sit for 10 to 15 minutes.	8
34	Place a non-stick or cast-iron pan on medium heat. Once it's hot, melt a small amount of butter, about 1/2 teaspoon, then ladle some pancake batter into the center of the pan. You can make your pancakes as large or small as you like. A normal amount is about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of batter. If it's your first time making pancakes, make them smaller: they'll be easier to flip.	8
35	As soon as the batter is in the pan, place 3 to 4 banana slices on top of the uncooked side of the pancake. Once the edges of the pancake start to dry up and you can see the middle start to bubble, flip the pancake over. Cook until it is browned on both sides. Stack the finished pancake on a plate in a warm oven and repeat the above process until you run out of batter.	8
36	Serve hot, with butter and syrup.	8
37	Squish the tofu between 2 heavy plates for 10 minutes, to drain some of the liquid. This helps it soak up more soy sauce and it will be crispier when you fry it. Pat it dry and slice it into 16 pieces.	9
38	Toss the tofu into a freezer bag with the soy sauce or tamari and let it marinate for 20 minutes, or up to a day.	9
39	Shred the carrots and daikon radish, if using a box grater or food processor. Daikon is traditional and it's fantastic, but they can be hard to find so don't feel like you can't make this without it. You should end up with approximately 2 cups of shredded carrot and 1 cup of shredded daikon. Add them to a bowl with the sugar and vinegar and toss. Leave them for 20 minutes to lightly pickle. You can leave them longer as well.	9
40	Heat a large pan on medium heat and add a tablespoon of vegetable oil. Remove the tofu from the soy sauce and place 8 slices in the pan face-down. They will splatter a bit as the soy sauce hits the hot oil so be careful and once you have them in the pan, cover it with a lid or a splatter guard. Let them fry until light brown on one side, then flip and fry them on the other. Once they are golden brown to your satisfaction remove them onto a plate. If you want to dab up any excess oil, lay a paper towel on the plate and place the slices on top.	9
41	Add the second tablespoon of oil to the pan and fry the other 8 slices.	9
42	While the tofu cools, add the cabbage, cucumber, and jalapeño if using. Drain the lightly pickled carrots and daikon and add them to the bowl. In a small bowl mix together the mayonnaise and sriracha. This is your dressing.	9
43	Add the dressing to the bowl and mix until everything is lightly coated. Split into 4 portions and top each with 4 pieces of fried tofu, cilantro to taste and wedge of lime.	9
44	Squeeze the lime juice overtop and enjoy!	9
45	Chop the raw beef into bite-sized pieces and season generously with salt and pepper.	10
46	Melt half the butter in a large saucepan on medium heat. Toss in enough beef to cover the bottom of the pan. You may need to cook the meat in two batches, depending on the size of your pan. Brown the meat on all sides, then set it aside on a plate.	10
47	Add the onions and carrots to the pan and cook until the onions become translucent. Sprinkle with the flour and paprika, then cover with water. Drop the meat back in the pot. Cover the pot with a lid, but leave it askew so the steam can escape. Cook on medium-low heat for 2 hours. This process will make the beef tender and turn the water into beef stock.	10
48	If you’re using a less tough cut of beef, you don’t need to cook nearly as long. Simply brown the meat, then substitute the water for 1 cup of beef stock and cook for 20 minutes. It’s a lot quicker, but of course tender meat is more expensive!	10
49	Meanwhile, in another pan on medium heat, melt the rest of the butter. Add the garlic and cook for about a minute. Add the mushrooms and toss to coat them with garlic and butter. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Let the mushrooms cook about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they brown and shrink. Turn off the heat and taste. Add salt and pepper as needed.	10
50	Cook the noodles (or any pasta) according to the package\r\ninstructions. Try to time it to coincide with finishing the stew	10
51	Check on the beef. If the water has reduced to approximately a cup of thick, flavorful liquid and the beef is tender, it’s done! If not, let it cook a little longer. Once it’s ready, stir in the mushrooms, sour cream, and mustard. Turn the heat down to low to keep it warm until the pasta is ready. Once again, taste and add more salt, pepper, and paprika if needed.	10
52	Put the noodles into bowls and top with the stew. Sprinkle a little paprika over top and enjoy!	10
53	Peel the raw beets, removing the stems if necessary, then shred the beets with a box grater. Place the beets in a bowl along with the chickpeas and nuts.	11
54	Mix up the dressing ingredients in another small bowl and stir to combine. Taste and adjust the salt and pepper to\r\nyour liking.	11
55	Add the dressing to the other bowl and mix up all the ingredients. Let it sit for about 5 minutes so that the flavors can soak into the vegetables and the beet juices can mingle with the dressing.	11
341	To pull the meat, remove it from the juices and gently tear the pork apart with two forks or with your hands. Discard any larger bits of fat that you don't wish to eat. If any section is hard to tear apart, the meat hasn't cooked enough to break down the connective tissue. If you have the time to spare, put it back in the oven for another couple of hours.	53
342	Once you've pulled all of the pork, mix in any remaining rub and move it to a casserole dish or a large plate. If you aren't eating the meat right away, stash it in the fridge.	53
344	Feel free to add a little barbecue sauce to the pork if it isn't flavorful enough for you, but try it first, I think you'll be surprised!	53
404	Remove the bay leaves from the adobo. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with a tablespoon of water, then stir it into the sauce. Let the sauce boil and thicken until the  chicken and vegetables are well glazed. Serve over the rice.	62
56	Make the sauce first. Put the peppers on a tray under your broiler. Turn them every few minutes, until they’re black and crinkly on all sides. Alternately, if you have a gas cooktop, you can use metal tongs to hold them over direct flame. Once the peppers are roasted, put them in a metal bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Leave the peppers to sweat for about 30 minutes, then peel off the skin.	12
57	Carefully slice the peppers in half and remove the placenta, seeds, and stem. Chop the peppers up roughly and set them aside.	12
58	Add the butter to a pot on medium heat. When it’s hot, add the garlic and cook a minute, until aromatized. Add the scallions and cilantro stems (if using) and cook for another minute. Add the flour and stir it until it has coated the vegetables.	12
59	Add the water and chopped, roasted, peppers. Bring the\r\nmixture to a boil, then turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 10 minutes.	12
60	If you have an immersion blender, purée the mixture\r\ndirectly in the pot. Otherwise, let it cool and use a\r\nblender. Once the sauce is smooth, add salt and pepper\r\nas necessary.	12
61	Turn the oven to 375 F.	12
62	For the filling, warm the butter on medium heat. Add the garlic and sauté for 30 seconds or until it smells good. Add the tomatoes and let them cook for about a minute until some of their juice has cooked off.	12
63	Add the beans to the pan and let them cook for a minute. Add the chipotle and water, stir and cover with a lid. Cook for about five minutes. Add the goat cheese and stir. If the mixture is too dry, add a bit more water.\r\nTaste, then adjust the salt and pepper as needed. Take the pan off the heat and set aside.	12
64	To assemble, distribute the filling evenly between the 4 or 6 tortillas, then roll them up. Place them in a baking dish and smother them with the sauce. Grate some cheese over the top if you’d like.	12
65	Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbling around the edges. Serve immediately with any of the garnishes suggested.	12
66	Soak the black-eyed peas overnight in 4 cups of water.	13
67	Melt the butter in a large saucepan on medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, bacon, and bay leaf. Cover the pan with a lid and leave it for 2 minutes. Stir occasionally and cook until the onions are translucent and the bacon is starting to be crispy. Drain the peas and pour them into the saucepan. Cover them with water and turn the heat down to medium-low. Cook for 30 minutes to 2 hours. The cooking time will depend on how old the peas are, which is difficult to predict. The peas are done when you can easily squish them on the countertop with the back of a spoon. Check on them every half hour or so, and if water boils off, add more to cover them.	13
68	While the peas cook, line up several collard leaves on your cutting board and slice the tough central stem away from the leaves. Discard the stems, then chop them into bite-sized pieces. Alternatively, use your hands to tear the collards into small pieces.	13
69	Once the peas are cooked, add the collards to the pot and put the lid back on. Add 1 teaspoon of salt and some freshly ground pepper, then stir. Taste the liquid and peas and add more salt as needed. Cover the pan with a lid and leave for about 10 to 15 minutes. Once the collards are tender, turn off the heat.	13
70	Serve this over rice or any other grain, or with some toast or flatbread	13
343	Optionally, if you want to make a sauce from the pot full of drippings, bring it to a gentle boil on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Let the juices thicken for 20 to 30 minutes. The fat will rise to the top: it's the clear, thick layer, not the thin, red liquid below. Skim off as much of the fat as possible. Mix a few spoonfuls of the pan drippings with the pork before serving.	53
646	Add all the ingredients for the crust to a bowl and mix until thoroughly combined. It will be a fairly crumbly mixture.	102
647	Press the crust mixture into the pan as evenly as possible. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.	102
648	For the filling, use an electric mixer to beat the butter with the confectioners sugar and vanilla until light and smooth. Add the pudding mix and milk and beat until light and smooth. It might be a little bit loose at first after adding the milk, but keep mixing and it will become light, fluffy, and green.	102
649	Spread the filling over the completely cooled crust and chill in the fridge until cold.	102
71	Place the stick of butter in the freezer for 20 minutes minimum, but an hour is better.	14
72	In a medium-sized bowl add the flour, salt and sugar and stir a couple of times to combine it all. Take the butter out of the freezer and use a box grater to grate the butter. Like in this image here.	14
650	For the topping, melt the butter in a small saucepan on low heat. Add the chocolate and let it melt into the butter on very low heat, stirring occasionally until melted and smooth.	102
651	Pour the topping over the filling in the pan and use a spatula to spread it as smoothly as possible—it doesn't have to be perfect. Sprinkle the 1/4 cup of pistachios (chopped as finely as possible, ideally in a food processor or coffee grinder) all over the chocolate to finish. Chill the bars in the fridge until they are set.	102
652	Once set, cut into 48 small or 24 larger bars. Keep in the fridge. They get soft quickly at room temperature. They freeze well and make great gifts for friends and co-workers!	102
345	If you’re making your own dumpling dough, add the flour and salt to a large bowl. Make a crater in the middle and crack in the eggs along with the water. Use one hand like a shovel to mix the dough into a shaggy mass. If it seems too dry, add water a few drops at a time. Knead the dough for a minute, then cover it with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rest for 30 minutes to 2 hours.	55
346	Choose one filling or the other. Mix all the filling ingredients in a large bowl.	55
73	Use the side with the largest holes like you would for cheese for nachos. You want bigger curls of butter, not teeny tiny fragments. Grate it as quickly as you can because your hands give off heat and you don't want the butter to melt at all. It should look like this.	14
74	Quickly add the butter into the bowl with the flour mixture and crumble it up with your fingers for 15 to 20 seconds. Add half the water and mix it quickly with your hands. Add the rest and mix again, then quickly and confidently bring the dough together into a ball. It does not need to be perfect, just make sure the dough all comes together into a lump without excess flour everywhere. Use a few more drops of water if you need to. Sometimes a drier climate can change the amount you need. Once it has come together quickly shape it into a disc and take your hands off it. Cover it with plastic wrap or a moist towel and place it in the fridge for 20 minutes.	14
75	Set the oven to 425 F. Line a cookie tray with parchment paper or a silpat. Do not skip this step. It really sticks to the pan if you don't do this and you don't want to lose any of your delicious crostata!	14
76	Now make the filling. In another large bowl add the blueberries, cornstarch or flour, zest, lemon juice and sugar. Mix it all together and leave it.	14
77	Once your pastry has chilled for at least 20 minutes (longer is just fine), take it out of the fridge. Sprinkle a clean, dry surface with flour and place your disc of dough in the centre.  Now roll it out with a rolling pin, gently press the rolling pin down and straight in front of you to flatten it. Once you have rolled it out a few times, turn it 90 degrees and flip it over and roll again. If it is sticking to the surface you are rolling on, sprinkle some more flour underneath it and on top. Continue with the rolling, turning it 90 degrees and flipping it technique until it is rolled out to about 10-12 inches in diameter.	14
78	Transfer your rolled out pastry to the parchment paper lined tray. Dump the filling into the middle of the pastry leaving at least 2 inches of pastry free of filling all the way around. Now pull up and fold the 2 inches of pastry up and around the filling to cover the edges and make a sort of rim. It will kind of look like a pie where the crust has fallen back over the filling. Just like this image.	14
79	In a small bowl crack an egg and quickly beat it with a fork. Brush the beaten egg all over the pastry. This is the egg wash that will make the pastry look golden brown when it bakes. Now sprinkle the tablespoon of sugar over the pastry. This is your crostata!	14
80	Bake the crostata on the lowest shelf for 35 minutes. By placing it on the lower shelf you can get the bottom of the crust as crisp as possible, since it can end up soggy with all the juices seeping into it.	14
81	Remove the crostata from the oven and let it cool for about 20 minutes before you try to remove it from the pan. Cool completely and place in the fridge for later, or serve right away.	14
82	Don't be shy about eating the whole thing in one sitting. That's what you made it for!	14
653	Measure out the flour, salt and a teaspoon of yeast into a big bowl. Mix the oil into the flour with your hands, crumbling it until the texture is a bit sandy, then add the room-temperature water. Keep mixing with your hands until it comes together.	103
654	Knead the dough on a lightly floured countertop for 5 to 7 minutes, until it becomes a smooth elastic ball. The dough\r\nwill be smooth but quite wet.	103
347	Once the dough has rested, split it into four chunks. Dust your countertop with flour, then roll the first piece of dough into a log. Leave the other pieces covered so that they don’t dry out.	55
407	Roll the dough into 24 small balls. Keep them covered with the towel.	63
83	In a large bowl add the flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Give it a quick stir just to blend the ingredients a little bit.	15
84	In another bowl, add the water, butter, egg and egg yolk and whisk to break up the yolks until it becomes a frothy yellow liquid.	15
85	You can make the dough either by hand or with a stand mixer so choose below which instructions to follow.	15
89	Cut up your cheese into small cubes rather than grating it so you have larger pockets of cheese. Add any additions like chiles or scallions in with the cheese and set it aside in a bowl.	15
153	Set oven to 250 F.	23
154	To make the caramel topping, heat the butter, sugar, corn syrup (yes I know corn syrup is awful, but it's not much, and it is important to keep the caramel from crystallizing, also who are we kidding this is caramel corn!) and salt in a medium-sized pot on medium heat. Once it comes to a boil, whisk vigorously for 2 to 3 minutes (to keep it from burning).  It should be dark brown, glossy and fairly thick. Now add the vanilla and whisk. Then sprinkle the baking soda over the sauce and whisk. It will bubble and become fluffy kind of like sponge candy.	23
155	Quickly pour the caramel all over the popcorn in the baking tray and stir it around, coating as many pieces of popcorn as possible in the caramel. It doesn't have to be perfect though, it will get coated more in the next step.	23
156	Bake the popcorn in the oven for 30 to 45 minutes, removing every 15 minutes to stir to coat more kernels in caramel. This low heat will melt the caramel just a bit, allowing you to fully coat the popcorn in caramel without having to mess with a candy thermometer.	23
157	While the caramel corn bakes, prepare the savoury popcorn. It's quicker!	23
158	Melt the butter in the microwave or a small pan.  Dump the finely chopped fresh rosemary into the butter along with a bit of black pepper and salt. When grating the Romano, try using the pointy side of the grater to create a very fine powder that will adhere to the popcorn best!	23
159	Pour the rosemary butter onto the popcorn and toss. Add a little cheese and toss. Repeat until you have used up all the butter or have the desired coverage.	23
160	Once your caramel corn is ready, mix it together with your rosemary popcorn and serve.	23
161	Melt the butter in a non-stick or cast-iron pan on medium-high heat. Add the sugar and let it melt into the butter for about 2 minutes. Place the bananas face\r\ndown in the butter-sugar mixture, then cook for 2 minutes or until they become brown and sticky. Carefully flip them over and do the same to the other side.	24
162	Serve them whole or split them into quarters. Drizzle any caramel left in the pan over the bananas. Serve with ice cream, on top of pudding or cake or simply on their own.	24
86	If using a mixer: Using the paddle attachment, turn the mixer to low and slowly pour the wet mixture into the flour mixture until it comes together into a shaggy dough. Once the dough comes together switch to the dough hook and knead on a low-medium setting for about 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.	15
87	If making by hand: Slowly pour the wet mixture into the flour mixture, using your hands or a wooden spoon, mix everything together until a shaggy dough forms. Once the dough is together in one ball, dump it out onto a clean, lightly floured counter and knead for 7 to 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth and elastic.	15
88	Grease another large bowl lightly with olive oil or butter. Shape the dough into a ball and place it face down into the greased bowl, then turn it over so that every side of the ball is lightly greased. Cover the top of the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm spot until it has doubled in size, 1.5-2 hours.	15
90	Lightly grease 12 standard muffin tins with olive oil or butter.	15
91	Once the dough has risen take it out of the bowl and place it on a lightly floured counter. Cut it into 12 evenly sized pieces. Place all but one of the pieces back in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap to keep them moist.	15
92	Roll out one piece of dough into an approximately 5 inch circle.	15
93	Cover the circle with about 1 oz of cheese cubes (and any other additions you have chosen. Dan really likes it with scallions and thinks they are much better with that addition).	15
94	Roll the dough up like a carpet with the cheese inside it.	15
95	Squeeze and pinch the ends of the roll shut to form a log.	15
96	Form the roll into a c-shape and press into one of the greased muffin tins. Repeat until you have stuffed and shaped all 12 buns.	15
97	Cover the buns with plastic wrap and once again let them rise for 1 to 1.5 hours until they have puffed up to about 1.5 times their size. (the photo adjacent is after they have risen)	15
99	Make egg wash by whisking one egg in a small bowl.	15
100	Once the buns have puffed up enough and are ready to bake, brush egg wash all over the tops of them generously. This will make them bake up golden brown and beautiful.	15
101	Set the muffin tins on top of a larger sheet pan to catch any of the cheese grease that will inevitably drool out the sides of the pan (this will prevent it from burning on the bottom of the oven). Bake for 25 minutes.	15
102	Remove the cheese buns from the oven and let them cool in the tins for at least 20 minutes. There will be a lot of hot, crunchy cheese that has exploded out of the buns and is baked onto the tray (yum!). Carefully remove them from the tins, using a butter knife to pry them up if required.	15
348	Cut the log into 15 equal slices, then use your hands to form one of the slices into a flat disc. With a rolling pin, flatten the disc into an almost paper-thin circle about the size of a drink coaster.	55
349	Place a heaping tablespoon of filling in the center of the dough. Lift all the edges to meet in the middle, then pinch it closed like a little parcel. If the dough won’t stick to itself, wet your fingertips and dab the edges.	55
350	Repeat until you run out of either filling or dough. This is a great time to ask for help from family or friends—one person rolling while others fill and cook.	55
351	Now, a tough decision: do you want to steam, fry, or boil your dumplings?	55
352	To steam them, spread a small amount of oil around a large pan. Fill the pan with dumplings—as many as you can fit without them sticking to each other. Turn the heat to medium and let them sizzle for about a minute. Once the dough has absorbed most of the oil, add about ½ cup of water to the pan, then quickly cover with a lid. The water will splatter and sizzle loudly. Leave the lid on for about a minute to steam the dumplings, then turn the heat down to low and remove the lid. Let it keep cooking until the water evaporates, then turn off\r\nthe heat. Your dumplings should be steamed on top with crispy, brown bottoms.	55
353	To pan-fry them instead, start following the technique above, but use more oil. Skip the water and the lid  entirely. Just keep frying! Once the dumplings are golden on one side, flip them to fry the other side. This method is awkward with parcel-style dumplings but works well for other shapes, so plan accordingly.	55
103	In a large mixing bowl add the flour, cornmeal and salt. The cornmeal is not traditional, I just like the extra crunch it gives, so you can substitute more wheat flour for the cornmeal if you like. Mix it up.	16
104	Place the butter in the freezer for 10 minutes. Take it out and grate the butter directly into the flour mixture. Wash and dry your hands, then crumble the butter into the flour until it looks like bread crumbs.	16
105	In a small bowl add the egg, water, and cider vinegar. Mix it with a fork. Add it to the dough and mix it until it just comes together.	16
106	Sprinkle a clean countertop with flour and dump the dough onto it. Gently and quickly bring the dough together to form a disc. If it is extremely dry sprinkle it with a bit of water. If you are using whole wheat flour sometimes the dough requires a bit more moisture. Wrap your dough disc in plastic wrap and place it in the fridge for about an hour. During this time the egg will release more of its moisture and the dough will be smoother and more uniform in texture when you use it.	16
354	Alternatively, boil the dumplings by dropping them into a pot of boiling water. When they rise to the top, they’re ready to eat, usually in 1 or 2 minutes.	55
655	Add a small amount of oil to a bowl. Place your dough ball in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rise for 1½ to 3 hours, depending on the warmth of your kitchen. It’s done rising when it has doubled in size. Then it’ll be ready to shape into your favorite pizza!	103
656	If you’re organized enough to make the slow dough, I\r\nrecommend taking the extra time: it’s the best.	103
98	Set the oven to 350 F.	124
356	Add ¼ cup of the salsa and stir to coat the bean mixture. Place your pan on a back burner on the lowest setting while you prepare the eggs and tortillas.	56
476	Once the onion and bean mixture has cooked for 45 minutes to an hour, add the cauliflower and chilies. Let the mixture cook for approximately 20 minutes, or until the cauliflower is tender.	73
477	Add the cream cheese, and cheddar and stir until it melts into the chili. Taste it and adjust salt, pepper and cayenne according to your taste.	73
110	Turn the oven to 400 F.	82
617	If you're using the chipotle en adobo, chop it finely to be sure the spice will be evenly distributed.	95
107	Alternatively, you can use the food processor to make the dough. First add the flours, pulse briefly, then cut up the butter into 8 pieces or so and add them. Pulse briefly until the flour and butter look crumbly. Then add the egg, vinegar and water and run the machine until the dough just seems to come together. Dump it out onto a floured surface and proceed with the recipe just as above.	16
108	In a saucepan on medium heat, add the broccoli. It might seem like a lot, but it will cook down and lose some of its volume. Add about 1 cup of water and cover with a lid. Let it cook for 2 minutes then add the chile flakes, garlic, salt and pepper. Toss it around to mix and cover again for another 2 minutes. Remove the lid and let the water cook off. Stick a fork in a piece of broccoli and if it goes in easily it's done. If not, cook for a bit longer.	16
109	Let the broccoli cool and then add it to a bowl with the grated cheese. Mix it up.	16
111	Prepare a baking pan by lining it with parchment paper, or use a silicone baking mat if you have one.	16
112	Take the dough out of the fridge. Divide it into 12 equal pieces and roll them each into balls. On a clean countertop dusted lightly with flour, use a rolling pin to roll each ball into a thin, flat circle. Add a mound of filling to one half of the dough and then flip half the dough over the filling to form a half moon. Pinch the edges shut. If you want to get fancy you can try crimping the dough, but so long as it's closed it'll cook just fine.	16
113	In a small bowl beat an egg with a fork.	16
114	Place the empanadas on the baking pan. Once you have finished assembling them brush them with the egg wash you made and then sprinkle them with a little bit of kosher salt if you have it. This is entirely optional!	16
115	Place them into the oven and let them bake for 15 minutes or until they turn golden brown. Eat them hot with whatever sauce you like. Chimichurri sauce is the best, so I’ll have to share that with you another time.	16
116	Slice the stem of the broccoli into 1/8th inch discs. If you can't get them that thin, don't worry, but the thinner the better if you have the patience! Once you reach the crown of the broccoli, cut each of the florets off and slice each of them as thinly as you can as well. Set the broccoli in a bowl.	17
117	Halve and core the apples, then place the apples flat side down on your cutting board to make them easier to slice. Slice the apples into 1/8th inch pieces as well, then dump them into the same bowl.	17
118	Choose either of the dressing options and prepare it by simply mixing the ingredients together in a small bowl. Taste it and season with more salt and pepper to match your preferences.	17
119	Pour the dressing over the bowl of vegetables and mix it all together.	17
120	If you put a plate in the fridge for 10 minutes before serving the salad, it'll stay crisp slightly longer. For the best presentation, pile the salad as high and tight as you can manage.	17
121	Steam the broccoli using one of these 3 methods below, then skip to step 5:	18
122	Steamer: Use your steamer according to it’s instructions. Steam for about 4 minutes until the broccoli is just tender.	18
123	Microwave: Place the broccoli pieces in a bowl and cover with 2 Tbsp water. Microwave for 2 minutes. If you can easily spear the broccoli with a fork and it goes through with no resistance it’s ready. Otherwise microwave it for another 30 seconds and continue until it is tender.	18
124	Stovetop: Fill a pot half-way with water and bring to a boil on high. Place a seive overtop of the pot, and make sure it is steady and secure. Most seive’s have little arms on the front that make it so you can rest it overtop of a bowl. Rest it overtop of the boiling water in the pot. Tumble the broccoli pieces into the seive and cover with a lid. Let it steam for 4 minutes until you can spear a piece with a fork and it meets no resistance.	18
125	Add the steamed broccoli, garlic, lemon juice, nuts, and cheese to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until it is a crumbly paste that isn’t flying around. Slowly add the olive oil and continue to process. Add the water and process some more. Taste and add salt and pepper. Add more lemon juice or cheese or anything else you think it needs. It should be quite loose and smooth. If it is still quite chunky add a little more olive oil or water and continue to process it. It should be loose enough that it will easily coat the noodles when you toss them.	18
126	Now scrape about half the broccoli pesto into a bowl with your noodles and save the rest for another use (maybe another salad or on toast!). Or you can use it all if you're so inclined of course!	18
127	Toss the noodles you made earlier with the pesto and you're done!	18
657	Use the same process as at left, but add only ½ teaspoon of yeast to the flour mixture. Rather than room temperature, the water should be very cold.	103
658	After you place the dough ball in a bowl and cover it, put it into the fridge overnight. Letting the yeast work\r\novernight creates a better flavor; it also makes the dough more elastic and easier to work with.	103
659	The next day, 2 to 3 hours before you want to bake your\r\npizzas, remove the dough from the fridge to return to room temperature.	103
355	In a medium pan on medium heat, melt one tablespoon of the butter. Add the drained beans and pepper and stir. Cook for 5 minutes or until the pepper starts to brown just a bit. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to your taste. If you use salt free canned beans you will need a healthy pinch of salt, but if they are salty don’t add too much. Taste it and adjust as you need it.	56
357	Place a large pan on medium high heat and add as many tortillas as will fit in the pan at once, I could do 3. The pan should be dry. No oil or butter needed. You are just toasting the tortillas. Heat the tortillas until they begin to bubble on one side just a bit. Flip and toast until you have a few brown spots on both sides of the tortilla. Do not toast until dark brown though, because then they will be a bit too crispy. You want them to remain pliable. Repeat with the last 3 tortillas and set aside on a plate.	56
128	To make the dough: measure out the flour, salt and a teaspoon of yeast into a big bowl. Mix the oil into the flour with your hands, crumbling it until the texture is a bit sandy, then add the room-temperature water. Keep mixing with your hands until it comes together.	19
129	Knead the dough on a lightly floured countertop for 5 to 7 minutes, until it becomes a smooth elastic ball. The dough will be smooth but quite wet. Add a small amount of oil to a bowl. Place your dough ball in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rise for 1½\r\nto 3 hours, depending on the warmth of your kitchen. It’s done rising when it has doubled in size.	19
130	When the dough has risen, turn the oven to 500 °F (or as hot as your oven gets).	19
131	Sprinkle a small amount of flour or cornmeal over a baking sheet and set aside.	19
132	Place a large pan on medium heat and add the olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the tough stem ends of the broccoli rabe and cook for 2 minutes. Next, add the rest of the broccoli rabe, including the leafy parts, along with the garlic, chili flakes, and anchovies. Give the rabe a stir and let it cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add salt and pepper to taste. The broccoli rabe is done when the stems are tender. Set the filling aside.	19
133	Divide the pizza dough into 4 equal pieces. Sprinkle flour over the countertop and place one of the four pieces of dough on it. Using your hands or a rolling pin, roll out the dough into a thin, flat circle. Pile ¼ of your\r\nbroccoli rabe mixture and ½ cup of mozzarella onto one side of the circle, leaving a lip around the edge. Gather up the half of the dough that isn’t weighed down with filling and fold it over top. Pinch the edges of the dough together to create a half-moon shape. Place it carefully on the prepared baking sheet and repeat until you have\r\nfour calzones.	19
134	Bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until the calzones are golden-brown on the outside. Be careful whenyou bite into them—they’ll be hot!	19
135	Turn on the broiler in your oven.	20
136	Split a grapefruit in half and place it on a baking tray or in an oven-proof pan. Sprinkle the pink halves evenly with sugar and top with just a tiny bit of salt to bring out the flavor.	20
137	Place the grapefruit halves under the broiler until they turn bubbly and a little brown (or even black) around\r\nthe edges. This usually takes about 3 minutes, but monitor it because every broiler is different. Don’t get distracted! Overbroiling ruins a good meal fast.	20
138	If you have maple syrup on hand, use it instead of sugar for even more flavor.	20
139	This breakfast will make a grapefruit lover out of you!	20
140	Chop off the ends of the sprouts. Slice them in half, then finely shred each half. Place the shreds in a bowl and sprinkle with salt and pepper.	21
141	Melt the butter in a non-stick pan on medium-high\r\nheat. Swirl it around to coat the pan. Add the Brussels sprout shreds and garlic, then leave it to cook for about 1 minute. Mix it up and toss it around. Add the olives and mix again.	21
142	Crack the eggs into separate areas of the pan. Sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Pour in 2 tablespoons of water and cover with a lid. Let the eggs steam, undisturbed, for 2 minutes.	21
143	Once the whites of the eggs are cooked through, turn off the heat and sprinkle everything with lemon juice.	21
144	Set oven to 425 F.	22
145	Cover a large sheet pan in tinfoil. Arrange the carrot slices in a single layer on the sheet pan.	22
146	In a small bowl melt the butter. Add the grated ginger and stir. Cook for about a minute or so until you can smell the ginger. Pour half the butter over the carrots, along with a generous pinch or two of salt and toss to coat. Try to keep as many carrot slices as possible touching the pan rather than piled on top of each other so you get more even roasting and they don't get soggy when cooked.	22
147	Roast for 20 to 25 minutes or until the center of each piece of carrot can be easily pierced with a fork.	22
148	Top with a little chopped parsley or dill if you have it around and finish with the rest of the ginger butter to your taste.	22
358	Now, in the same pan on medium-high heat melt the last tablespoon of butter and swirl it around the pan to coat. Crack as many eggs into the pan as you can fit and sprinkle each with a little salt and pepper. My pan could do 4, but I did 3 at a time so I could do it in even batches. Cook the eggs to your preferences, sunny-side up or medium or whatever. I like my eggs over easy. To get over easy eggs, cook the eggs until the whites are no longer clear, but the yolks are very runny, usually 1 minute to 1.5 minutes. Quickly and gently flip them over, leave for about 10 seconds and then turn off the heat. This method ensures that the yolk is fully cooked, but the yolk remains runny when you poke it with a fork. Set the 3 eggs aside on a plate and repeat with the next 3.	56
359	Time to assemble. On each plate place 2 tortillas. Spoon approximately 1/6th of the bean mixture (take it off the back burner you had it on and turn off the heat) on each tortilla. Gently place an egg on top of the bean mixture. Drizzle with salsa and sprinkle green onions.	56
360	Add any other additions you have around, but these are perfect just as they are.	56
660	Use any kind of lovely tomatoes you have. I really enjoy this with sliced up baby tomatoes that kind of explode in your mouth when you bite them, but bigger ones are great too.	104
362	Test the potato by piercing one piece with a fork. If it goes through easily, you’re done. If not, cook for a few more minutes. (The smaller the potatoes are chopped, the quicker they’ll cook.) Taste and adjust the seasoning to your preferences.	57
149	Place a large pot with a tight-fitting lid on the stove. Pour in the vegetable oil, then the popcorn kernels. Put the lid on and turn the heat to medium.	23
150	Using pot holders or oven mitts, occasionally shake the pot from side to side to make sure the kernels are evenly distributed in the oil.	23
151	Once the popcorn begins to pop, turn the heat down to medium-low and gently shake again. Once the popping slows down to 5 to 10 seconds between pops, turn the heat off. Wait until you're sure the corn has stopped popping and remove the lid.	23
152	Separate the popcorn into 2 portions, one in a large bowl and the other in a baking tray.	23
405	In a large bowl, whisk the dry ingredients. Add clarified butter or lard. Lard is more traditional, but I prefer butter. Using your fingers, squish the butter against the flour until the mixture looks like moist crumbs.	63
406	Add the hot water—not boiling, just hot—and form into a dough with your hands. Leave the dough in the bowl for an hour, covered by plastic wrap or a moist towel.	63
408	Lightly flour your countertop. Gently flatten one dough ball with your palm, then roll it out with a rolling pin. Flip it over to make sure it doesn't stick to the counter; add more flour if it does stick. Once you have the ball rolled out nice and thin, set it aside under a moist towel.	63
163	Melt the last tablespoon of butter in a pan on low heat. Add the onions and let them cook slowly, about 20 minutes. As the onions darken, stir them occasionally, adding a bit of water to loosen up the sticky onion bits on the bottom and keep them from burning. Leave the onions until they’re dark purple. They will now be sweet and caramelized.	25
164	Melt 1/2 tablespoon of butter in a small pan on medium heat. Place the two slices of bread in the pan and let them cook for about 2 minutes, then lift them with a spatula to check whether they’re golden brown underneath. When they are, flip ’em over. Add the rest of the butter to the pan to make sure the second side of the toast becomes just as golden as the first. Sprinkle the top of the bread with salt and pepper. Once the second side is golden, set the bread on a plate to await its topping.	25
165	Spread them over toast and top with slices of sharp cheddar, salt, and pepper. Put the toast back in the pan and cover with a lid until the cheese is bubbly, then serve it up.	25
166	Set the oven to 350 F. \r\n\r\nPrepare an 8 inch round cake pan or springform pan by buttering or oiling the bottom or sides. Or if you are very concerned about having the edges of the cake come out perfectly you can line the pan with baking parchment and then butter or oil those. But since you are covering this with cream cheese frosting I often skip this step.	26
167	In a medium bowl add the brown sugar and oil and whisk vigorously to combine for about a minute. Add the eggs, one at a time and whisk, until the sugar mixture is smooth and light. Add the sour cream and vanilla and whisk once more.	26
168	Next, add the carrot and pineapple to the wet mixture and gently stir to combine with a wooden spoon. Set aside.	26
169	In another bowl combine the flour, cinnamon, baking soda and salt and stir a couple of times to blend.	26
170	Pour the flour mixture into the wet mixture and gently stir together until just combined.	26
171	Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan and bake for 1 hour or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.	26
172	Let the cake cool while you make your frosting.	26
173	For the cream cheese frosting: Add the cream cheese and butter to a large bowl and mix with an electric mixture for about a minute. Carefully add the confectioners sugar being sure not to let it puff up and make a mess. Continue to beat the frosting for another 5 minutes or so until it is lighter in color and fluffier. Add the vanilla or pineapple juice and mix one last time. Set aside.	26
174	Once the carrot cake has completely cooled remove it from it's pan. If you want to make an elegant layer cake like the one pictured, carefully slice the cake in half through the middle.	26
175	Place a sheet of parchment paper underneath the plate or stand you want to serve the cake on and place the bottom half of the cake on top of it.	26
176	Add 1/3rd of the frosting to the top of the cake half and spread it into an even layer, leaving about 1/2 inch of space from edge.	26
177	Place the 2nd layer of cake overtop of the frosted side.	26
178	Add 1/3rd of the frosting to the top and the rest to the sides of the cake, using a butter knife or flat spatula to spread the frosting as smoothly as you like.	26
179	Swirls and imperfections look lovely so don't worry about making it perfect. Carefully remove the parchment from beneath the cake.	26
180	Once the cake is frosted you can stop there or add any other flourishes like candied pineapple or fresh pineapple chunks or even sprinkles. Enjoy your beautiful creation!	26
181	Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat. Add the salt and the cauliflower, then leave it for 4 minutes.	27
182	Meanwhile, butter a baking dish large enough to comfortably accommodate all the cauliflower. I usually use a pie dish. Drain the water from the cauliflower and pour it into the baking dish.	27
183	To make the sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan on medium heat. Add the garlic, chile flakes, and bay leaf, then cook for about 1 minute. Add the flour and stir quickly. The flour-butter mixture is called a roux. You want the roux to get just a little brown; this will probably take another minute. Slowly add the milk to the pot, stirring all the while to incorporate the roux. Bring the sauce to a boil, stirring every now and then to make sure the sauce doesn’t get scorched on the bottom. Once it comes to a boil, turn off the heat and stir in the cheese. Drop in any additions at this point. Taste the sauce and add salt and pepper as needed. You should have a creamy, smooth, savory sauce.	27
184	Pour the sauce over the cauliflower. Place the dish in the oven for 40 minutes, or until the top is brown and bubbly. You can also add some breadcrumbs to the top of the dish before baking if you like extra crunch.	27
185	Enjoy with a green salad. I also like mine with salsa.	27
186	Turn the oven to 400 °F.	28
187	In a medium-sized roasting pan, arrange the cauliflower pieces and the unpeeled cloves of garlic. Pour the butter over the cauliflower and then sprinkle the spices over top. Use your hands to thoroughly coat the cauliflower with butter and spices.	28
188	Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on how crispy you like the florets. Squeeze the roasted garlic throughout and trash the skins.	28
189	On medium high heat warm up the tortillas one or two at a time until light brown spots appear on both sides and they are pliable and just a little bit crispy.	28
190	Place two to three tortillas on each plate and fill with a\r\ngenerous serving of cauliflower. Sprinkle the grated cheese over top and drizzle with salsa or sauce of your choice.	28
661	Toss the tomatoes, salami, olive oil and basil in the bowl with a healthy pinch of salt, to taste. In addition to bringing out the flavor, the salt will also make the juices from the tomato release so you get a kind of dressing from the tomato juice. Mix it. Add the noodles you made earlier and toss it all together. The juices from the tomatoes will make the noodles very slurpable.	104
191	Measure out all the spices except the cumin seeds and put them in a small bowl.	29
273	Add the tomatoes and beans, then simmer until the sauce is thick and the sausage is cooked, about 5 minutes on medium heat. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed.	41
274	Because this sauce contains meat, it won’t keep especially long in the fridge, but you can freeze it for later use if you don’t plan to eat it all within a few days.	41
275	In a mixing bowl add the tahini, peanut butter, hot sauce, soy sauce and water. Whisk until you have a smooth, thin dressing. Add a little more water if it’s too thick. Taste and add more hot sauce or soy sauce if you think it is not quite salty or spicy enough.	42
192	Let the ghee (clarified butter) melt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. (Ghee is the traditional Indian choice, but you can substitute butter if you can't find ghee.) Once the ghee begins to sizzle, add the cumin seeds and stir for about 5 seconds. Add the onion and saute for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the ginger and jalapeno and cook for 1 more minute. Add the spices and then the pureed tomatoes. Mix, then put a lid on the pan and let everything cook down for 5 to 10 minutes.	29
193	Once the tomato has reduced and the ghee starts to separate from the sauce, add the chickpeas and water. Mix, then bring it to a boil before reducing to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes, then squish a few chickpeas with a spoon to thicken the sauce. Garnish with yogurt and cilantro. For a full meal, serve over rice or with roti.	29
194	Chop off both ends of the zucchini, then slice each into four long sticks. Shuck the corn. Lay the zucchini and corn on a baking tray, then rub them with oil, making sure they're well coated. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.	30
195	Broil (or barbecue) for 2 to 5 minutes, depending on how powerful your broiler is. Turn the corn over to make sure it cooks evenly. The zucchini should start to blacken in some spots. This is good! Broil for another 2 to 5 minutes, until the vegetables are lightly charred.	30
196	Mix the dressing in a large bowl. Taste it and adjust to your preferences.	30
197	Chop the zucchini into bite-sized pieces and slice the corn kernels from the cob. Transfer the vegetables into the bowl with the dressing. Add the crumbled cotija or feta and mix. Sprinkle popcorn over top, then dust with a little extra chili powder, salt, and pepper.	30
198	If you are using a can of salmon, simply drain it and transfer the flaked salmon to a bowl and add the smoked paprika and salt to taste. Skip the cooking salmon steps!	31
199	Pat your salmon fillet dry with a paper towel. It's fine to use one with skin on or off, just know that if you are using skin on you will peel it off after you cook it. Sprinkle the fillet with salt generously and the smoked paprika.	31
200	Let the pan warm up for a few minutes on medium high heat. Add the butter and let it melt and swirl in the pan (this should go quickly with your pan quite hot). Add the salmon fillet skin-side down (if using skin on) and cover with a lid to steam and cook for about 3 minutes.	31
201	After three minutes check on the salmon, if it's a thinner piece it may already be lighter in color and cooked through. Flip it quickly onto the other side and cook for another minute with the lid on the pan. If your salmon is cooked through (you can test by poking it with a finger, it should feel quite firm, or you can stick it with a knife and see if it is opaque orange all the way through). If you are not pregnant and can eat the salmon a rare then cook to your preference! take it off the heat and let it cool down.	31
202	In a bowl mix together the cream cheese, dill, scallions and pepper. You will have way more cream cheese spread than you need for these toasts, but save it for later and eat it on bagels or sandwiches (or make more salmon toasts!).	31
203	Cut your bread and toast it.	31
204	Once the salmon has cooled enough to touch use a fork to gently break it up into pieces. Taste and sprinkle with a little more smoked paprika or salt if needed.	31
205	Spread a couple tablespoons (or whatever amount you like!) on the toast and top with about 1/4-1/3 of the salmon. Top with cucumber slices and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.	31
361	Melt half the butter in a pan on medium heat, then throw in the potato and cook for 5 minutes, stirring minimally. Season with salt and pepper. Add the mushrooms and garlic, as well as a splash of water if the potatoes are getting stuck to the pan. Cook for another 5 minutes, until the mushrooms are brown and have shrunk down.	57
363	Melt the other teaspoon of butter in another pan on medium heat. Crack the eggs into the pan and dust with salt and pepper again. Salt and pepper are critical to these ingredients, so don’t worry about overdoing it.	57
364	If you like your eggs sunny-side up, place a lid over the pan to ensure the whites will cook through without making the yolks hard. Once the whites are no longer translucent, take them off the heat.	57
365	If you like eggs over-easy (my favorite), wait until the yolks are cooked but still look runny, then flip each egg with a spatula and let the other side cook for about 15 seconds. That’ll get your whites fully cooked, but keep the yolks runny—the best. If you prefer hard yolks (please no!), then cook for a little longer.	57
366	Toast the bread or bun, then assemble it into a sandwich, using any condiments you like. Way better than what you’ll find at the corner deli.	57
662	Taste the noodles and add more salt or tomatoes or anything you think it needs. Enjoy!	104
206	In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Pour in the yogurt, eggs, and a tablespoon of water. Mix it slowly and carefully. The dough will be quite sticky. Cover it with a towel or plastic wrap while you make the\r\nfilling.	32
207	Put the chopped potatoes in a pot and cover with water, then add a bit of salt. Cover with a lid and bring to a boil over medium-high heat before removing the lid. Let the potatoes cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Test them with a fork: if it goes through easily, they’re done.	32
209	Flour your countertop liberally. Split the dough in half. Keep one half covered, but place the other half on the floured surface. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough, about ¼” thick. Punch out as many 3” to 4” dough\r\ncircles as possible, using a round cookie cutter or a drinking glass. Squish the scraps into the remaining covered half of the dough.	32
276	Add the noodles you made earlier and toss to coat. Then add the scallion and cucumber and toss again. Sprinkle with sesame seeds for a pretty garnish and enjoy!	42
277	Heat the oven to 350 F.	43
278	Spread the coconut into a thin, even layer on a cookie sheet. Place it in the oven for 5 to 8 minutes, until it's light brown, toasty, and aromatic.	43
279	Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat. Once it's melted, leave it to cool in the pan for a few minutes.	43
280	In a medium-sized bowl, stir together the flour, salt, and baking soda.	43
281	In another bowl, beat the brown sugar and melted butter together for about 2 minutes, until it's smooth. Add the eggs and vanilla and beat for about 5 minutes, until the mixture lightens in color.	43
283	Place the dough in the fridge for 20 minutes.	43
286	Continue the process until you've baked all the cookies.	43
208	Drain the potatoes and add grated cheese, salt, pepper, and any additions from the list (do consider holiday leftovers here!). I like strong aged cheese because you don’t have to use as much. I usually use several additions, and you should play around with some of your favorite things—there aren’t many flavors that don’t work in potatoes! Next, mash the potatoes with an\r\nelectric mixer or just two forks. Once the filling is ready, gather some friends because shaping takes some time!	32
210	Drop about a tablespoon of filling in the center of one circle of dough. Fold the dough over the filling and press the edges to create a dumpling. The stickiness of the dough should ensure a tight seal.	32
211	Lay the dumpling on a floured surface and use a fork to squish the edges together. Repeat until you run out of circles, then repeat everything with the remaining dough.	32
212	Once you have all your perogies formed, boil a pot of water and add about 12 perogies. Let them cook until they rise to the top, about 1 minute. Pull out the boiled perogies with a spoon, making sure they are drained of water, then repeat with the remainder in the same pot of water.	32
213	If you’re planning to freeze some of the perogies, let them cool down post-boiling and then put them in freezer bags with the air squeezed out. I usually\r\ndo 12 to a bag, but you can portion them out in whatever way suits you. They will keep for at least 6 months in the freezer.	32
214	You can eat the perogies just boiled, but if you’re anything like my family, you’ll prefer them fried afterwards. Melt a tablespoon of butter in a pan on medium heat, then fry up as many perogies as you want. (Six per person is plenty, these are really rich and filling.) Flip them every few minutes until they’re browned on all sides. Serve with scallions and a dollop of sour cream.	32
215	In a small pot on medium heat melt the butter. Add the shallot or onion and cook for two minutes just to aromatize. Add the tomato and sprinkle a little salt. Let it cook for 3 minutes until the tomatoes have released a bunch of their juice.	33
216	Add the green chiles to the pot and stir. Cook for another two minutes or so, then add the chickpeas and a little more salt. Stir and cook until everything is warmed through. Taste and add more salt if you think it needs it.	33
217	Now assemble the bowl! Spoon the warm chickpea mixture in the middle of the bowl and pile shredded lettuce on one side and sprinkle cheese on the other. Add any other additions you have around.	33
218	Cook the chickpeas (skip this step if using canned chickpeas): Rinse the dried chickpeas and let them sit submerged in cold water for a few minutes. Pick out any chickpeas or random bits that rise to the top and discard. Drain the rinsed chickpeas and place into a pot along with the salt and cover with at least 4 inches of water above the line of chickpeas. Bring to a boil on high heat, then turn the heat to low and maintain a gentle simmer. Check on the beans every half hour or so, making sure to keep them covered with water if it boils away. Cook for 1 1/2 to 3 hours, until the chickpeas are soft and cooked through. To lessen the simmering time, you can soak the chickpeas in water overnight, which can cut down on cooking time by an hour or more. Once chickpeas are cooked, store them in their cooking liquid, but drain them before adding to salad.	34
219	In a large bowl whisk together the peanut butter, sriracha or sambal oelek, lime juice, fish sauce (if using), and a sprinkling of salt. If you have it around and think the dressing could use a more salty hit, add a teaspoon or so of soy sauce and taste. At this point, the dressing will still be fairly thick and sticky, so drizzle a bit of water in and whisk. Keep adding water and whisking until you have a pourable dressing. Taste and add more salt, lime juice, or peanut butter to your liking.	34
220	In the bowl with the dressing, add the chickpeas, shredded cabbage, and carrots and toss it all together with tongs until everything is coated.	34
221	Pile it into bowls and top with scallions, chopped cilantro, and peanuts if desired.	34
222	In a large bowl add the cashew butter, sriracha (or any chili sauce you like), lime juice, water and a little salt. Whisk it together and if it is still pretty thick add a bit more water until it is thin and runny enough to swirl around the bowl easily. Taste it and add more salt if you need it. Mine needed a healthy pinch because I was using cashew butter with no added salt.	35
223	Now add the chickpeas, cucumber, tomato, avocado and tortilla chips. With a pair of tongs or a spoon toss all the ingredients together with the dressing until everything is nicely coated and mixed. Just like this.	35
224	Pile it as prettily as you can into a bowl, sprinkle it with chopped scallions and serve! I eat all of this myself, but usually not all in one sitting. I eat most of it at lunch and then slowly grab a bite or two throughout the afternoon. It keeps me going so I can wait for a later evening dinner.	35
225	Whisk the chipotle, lime juice, and honey in a small bowl and set aside.	36
226	Turn on your broiler. Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil and pour a small amount of olive oil onto the foil. This is just to keep the fish from sticking.	36
227	Sprinkle about 1/4 tsp of salt and pepper all over each fish fillet. Place them on the prepared pan and pour the glaze over the top. Flip them over to make sure they are evenly covered all over.	36
228	Let the fillets sit for 5 minutes.	36
229	While you wait, make your mango salsa. Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl and then taste. Add more salt, pepper and lime juice according to your taste.	36
374	This keeps very well and travels nicely to a picnic or potluck. Have fun!	58
230	Place the fillets in the oven under the broiler and set the timer for 5 minutes. Watch carefully. You will need to adjust the cooking time depending on the size of your fillets. For the small Tilapia fillets we had they took 5 minutes and were perfectly juicy and flaky. If you have bigger fillets or thicker cuts like Halibut then leave them in a few more minutes. You can tell they are properly cooke when they flake apart when poked with a knife.	36
231	Toast your tortillas in a pan on medium heat until a few light brown bubbles form on each side. Place two tortillas on two plates and divide the two fillets across the four tortillas. Spoon mango salsa generously over each and sprinkle with more scallions and cilantro.	36
232	Set the oven to 450 F.	37
233	While the oven warms, slice the stem ends of the brussels sprouts off and then cut them in half. Toss the halved sprouts into a bowl.	37
234	Make the sauce by mixing together the chipotles themselves (make sure they are as finely chopped as you can make them), the adobo sauce (this is the sauce the chipotles come in and we want both the sauce and the peppers), honey, garlic, melted butter and salt. Stir it up and give it a taste. If you want to add more salt, honey or chipotle go right ahead.	37
235	Cut the chicken breasts in half if you have a smaller appetite or are doing some portion control, otherwise, sprinkle salt and pepper all over the chicken breasts, then slather the outside of the breasts with about half the sauce, saving the rest. Rub the sauce all over and place the chicken breasts on one half of the sheet pan.	37
236	Melt the remaining butter and pour the melted butter over the brussels sprouts. Generously season with salt and pepper. Drizzle about a tablespoon of the chipotle honey sauce all over the brussels and and finally mix it all together with your hands or a spoon. You should still have some sauce left over for when the chicken comes out of the oven.	37
237	Tumble the brussels sprouts onto the other side of the sheet pan and spread out into an even layer.	37
238	Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the brussels sprouts are tender and some of the outside leaves have blackened. While cooking you might get a bit of smoke as the honey burns on the edges of the sheet pan, but don't worry, it is just getting roasty and delicious.	37
239	To be 100% your chicken is cooked through you can use a meat thermometer. Stab the thermometer into the center of the thickest part of the meat and if it registers 165F you're good! You can also cut into the meat to make sure, but 25 minutes at that heat should be good enough, and to avoid dry meat it's best to let the chicken rest a bit before cutting into it so you don't lose the juices.	37
240	After you have pulled the pan out of the oven and let the chicken rest for a few minutes, serve it up by piling plates high with brussels sprouts, then slice the chicken into a few pieces and lay it on top of the brussels sprouts pile. Drizzle the remaining sauce over the top and enjoy!	37
241	In a mortar and pestle pound the chiles, cocoa nibs and cardamom pods just enough to break them up and release their aromas. Pour them into a jar with a tight fitting lid, a canning jar is best. Pour the alcohol over the spices and seal the jar.	38
242	Leave the jar for 2 to 4 weeks shaking it once each day.	38
367	Smaller potatoes are best, but whatever you’ve got will be fine! If you’re using very large potatoes, chop them into halves or quarters to speed up the cooking—or dice them into bite-sized pieces if you’re really in a hurry. Otherwise, keep the potatoes whole.	58
368	Cover the potatoes with water in a large pot with a lid. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, then turn the heat down to medium and set the lid askew so that steam can escape.	58
369	After about 25 minutes, try piercing the largest potato with a fork. If the fork pierces the potato easily, it’s fully\r\ncooked. If not, boil for 5 more minutes. It’s fine if they’re a little overcooked, but undercooked potatoes are awful.	58
370	Drain the water. Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle safely (but still warm), roughly chop them into bitesized pieces, if you haven’t already.	58
244	Freeze the butter for 20 minutes minimum, but an hour is better.	39
245	In a medium-sized bowl add the flour, salt and sugar and stir a couple of times to combine it all. Take the butter out of the freezer and use a box grater to grate the butter.	39
282	Mix the flour mixture with the brown sugar mixture, a third at a time, until it forms a dark brown, homogeneous mass. Add the chocolate chips and coconut and stir until just combined.	43
284	Take the dough from the fridge and scoop tablespoons of dough onto a lightly buttered or parchment lined cookie sheet, leaving large spaces between each cookie so they have space to spread out. I usually do about 6 cookies per sheet. Just before putting the cookies into the oven, sprinkle them with salt.	43
285	Let the cookies bake for 8 to 10 minutes. After you take them out of the oven, leave them on the sheet to set for 2 minutes, then move them to plates to cool further. Don't stack the cookies until they've cooled fully.	43
287	Store the finished cookies in an airtight container.	43
288	In a small pot, add the oats, water, salt, coconut and sugar. Place it on medium-high heat, just until the water comes to a boil.	44
289	Turn off the heat and squeeze the juice of half a lime over the top.	44
290	Prepare the noodles according to the package instructions. Rinse them under cold water and put them in\r\na colander to drain.	45
291	Put the noodles in a bowl and add the soy sauce, spice oil or peanut sauce if you have it, scallions, and cucumber (and any other additions). Mix it all together with a fork or a tongs. Taste it and add salt and pepper or more spice oil as needed.	45
292	Let the noodles sit in the fridge for about an hour if you can. The flavors will mingle and become more intense.	45
293	Think of this as a recipe that you can really make your own. Use whatever sauce or dressing you like and\r\nwhatever vegetables you have around, or just a few scallions.	45
294	Heat the oven to 450 F.	46
295	Set up your breading station! On one plate, spread out the flour. Crack both eggs into a bowl, add the milk, and beat lightly with a fork. On another plate, spread the cornmeal, salt, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder and mix them up with your fingers.	46
296	Spread a small amount of oil or butter across a baking sheet.	46
246	Use the side with the largest holes like you would for cheese for nachos. You want bigger curls of butter, not teeny tiny fragments. Grate it as quickly as you can because your hands give off heat and you don't want the butter to melt at all.	39
247	Quickly add the butter into the bowl with the flour mixture and crumble it up with your fingers for 15 to 20 seconds. Add half the water and mix it quickly with your hands. Add the rest and mix again, then quickly and confidently bring the dough together into a ball. It does not need to be perfect, just make sure the dough all comes together into a lump without excess flour everywhere. Use a few more drops of water if you need to. Sometimes a drier climate can change the amount you need. Once it has come together, quickly shape it into a disc and take your hands off it. Cover it with plastic wrap or a moist towel and place it in the fridge for 20 minutes.	39
248	Sprinkle a clean, dry surface with flour and place your dough in the centre.  Now roll it out with a rolling pin, gently press the rolling pin down and straight in front of you to flatten it. Once you have rolled it out a few times, turn it 90 degrees and flip it over and roll again. If it is sticking to the surface you are rolling on, sprinkle some more flour underneath it and on top. Continue with the rolling, turning it 90 degrees and flipping it technique until it is rolled out to about 10-12 inches in diameter.	39
249	Transfer the rolled out dough to a 9-inch pie plate, pressing it into the bottom and letting any excess dough hang down the sides. You want about 1/2 inch of excess pastry hanging all the way around the rim. Trim away any pieces that are longer. Use your fingers in a pinching motion to roll excess dough up to create an edge on the lip of the pie plate. Squish this down with your fingers or a fork to create a rim around the lip of the pie. Alternatively, use a pinching motion to crimp the edge. If you are a bit mystified by this process check out this pie crimping video tutorial by my friend, Nicki Sizemore.	39
250	Refrigerate the pie dough in the pie plate and set the oven to 375 F. Once the oven is ready you are going to blind-bake the crust. We need to partially cook it because our filling will take less time to cook than the pastry, so we want to give it a head start.	39
251	Cut out a square of parchment paper large enough to cover the inside of the pie dish and come up the sides with excess paper. Place the parchment over the pie crust in the dish and fill the paper with dried beans or rice or lentils. Any kind of hearty dry good will do. This will weight down the crust to keep it from shrinking.	39
252	Bake the crust with the dried beans in it for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, make the coconut and chocolate custards.	39
253	In a small pot on medium heat, whisk the coconut milk and sugar together and bring to a low boil.	39
254	In a medium metal (or heatproof) bowl add the egg yolks and pinch of salt. Whisk for about 30 seconds to combine.	39
255	Take the hot coconut milk off the heat and pour just a few drops into the egg yolks, whisking briskly. Wait a moment, then add a few more drops of coconut milk mixture and whisk. Slowly pour the coconut milk mixture a bit at a time into the egg yolks, whisking between each addition. You want it to combine into a lovely, bright yellow, thick custard but don't add the hot coconut milk too quickly or it will scramble the eggs.	39
256	Once all the coconut milk and sugar is incorporated into the egg yolks, pour out 1 cup (this is exactly half the custard) worth of the mixture into a large cup or bowl.	39
257	Warm the chocolate in the microwave (or on low heat in a pan on the stovetop) until just melted.	39
258	To one cup of coconut custard add the chocolate and whisk until combined. To the other cup add the 1/2 cup of coconut shreds. These are the two sides of our swirl pie!	39
259	Once the pie shell has baked for 25 minutes remove it from the oven and let it cool enough to remove the parchment paper and dried beans. Turn the oven down to 350 F.	39
260	Whisk up the final egg with a fork to make an egg wash and then brush the edges of the partially baked pie crust with egg all the way around and about 1 1/2 inches down the side of the crust.	39
261	Holding one mixture in each hand, gently and deliberately pour each mixture into one half of the pie crust. They will meet in the middle and mix together a bit, but try to keep them a bit separated like a ying and yang sign.	39
262	Using a butter knife or chopstick, gently instert your knife into the chocolate side of the pie filling and pull some of the chocolate filling across into the coconut side. Do this a few times to swirl them together a bit without completely mixing them up.	39
263	Once the fillings are swirled to your satisfaction bake in the oven for 40 minutes or until the center is no longer jiggly. Cool to room temperature, then place in fridge to chill fully. Once completely cool, pull out, cut into slices and serve at room temperature.	39
264	Preheat the oven to 350 °F.	40
265	Cut off the round end of the zucchini (which is a little tough), but keep the stem to use as a handhold. Shred the zucchini with a box grater, stopping when you get to the stem.	40
266	Butter or oil 24 muffing tins, or just line them with muffin cups.	40
267	Measure the dry ingredients (flour, oats, cocoa powder, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt) into a medium bowl.	40
268	Mix the zucchini, eggs, and yogurt in a larger bowl. Add the dry ingredients, then mix until everything is just combined. Add the chocolate chips if you're using them, then stir once.	40
269	With a spoon, dollop the batter into the muffin tins until each cup is 3/4 full and bake for 20 minutes.	40
270	Pull the muffins out and poke with a toothpick or knife. If it comes out wet, bake the muffins for 5 more minutes. Let the muffins cool in their tins for 20 to 30 minutes, then eat them warm!	40
371	In a large bowl, mix the olive oil, citrus juice or vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper. Whisk it briskly until the liquid\r\nis blended. If you don’t have a whisk, simply whip with a fork.	58
372	Throw the potatoes into the bowl and stir to coat them in the dressing. Add a generous amount of salt as you stir. Potatoes are very bland without salt! Then let them marinate for 10 minutes.	58
271	Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat and swirl it to coat the pan.	41
272	Add the chopped onion and cook until it turns translucent. Toss in the garlic, jalapeño, and fresh chorizo (or any other kind of fresh sausage), then sauté for about a minute.	41
373	Chop a handful of scallions and sprinkle them over top. Toss the salad once more, then taste and adjust the salt, pepper, and vinegar as you see fit.	58
571	You can enjoy the soup as-is or serve it with another drizzle of coconut milk or a dollop of sour cream, plus some chopped scallions or cilantro.	89
297	A few at a time, take the green beans and dredge them in the flour. Next, transfer the flour-covered beans to the egg mixture. Cover the beans lightly with egg mixture, being careful to shake off any excess egg. Then transfer to the cornmeal mixture and coat them evenly.	46
298	Carefully spread the crusted green beans onto the baking sheet. Repeat until you've done them all. If you run out of any of the three mixtures, just mix up a bit more.	46
299	Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until golden and crispy. Enjoy hot with your favorite dipping sauce!	46
300	Heat the oil or butter in a large pot on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the onion. Let the onion cook\r\nuntil translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the bell pepper and jalapeño, then let everything cook until it starts to brown.	47
301	Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir. Don't worry if it seems a little dry. We're about to add some moisture. Next, sprinkle the cumin and oregano over the vegetables and flour and stir.	47
302	Drizzle a bit of broth into the pot to get the sticky vegetables off the bottom of the pan, then add the cauliflower. Stir it all together and let it cook for about a minute with the lid on.	47
303	Finally, add the rest of your broth and cook for about 10\r\nminutes, or until the cauliflower is soft.	47
304	With an immersion blender, blitz the soup until creamy (don’t worry about getting every last piece). Taste it, then add salt and pepper and heavy cream (if using). If you like your soup a little thinner, add a bit more broth. Taste and adjust salt and pepper to your taste.	47
305	Sprinkle cheddar and green onions on top before serving, preferably alongside a sliced and toasted baguette.	47
306	Bring a pot of water to boil over high heat. Salt the water liberally. This is how pasta gets salted, so don't be shy! Most won't end up in the pasta.	48
307	Cook the pasta according to the package directions. I prefer my pasta with some bite, so I drain the pasta just before it's finished so it doesn't get mushy when I add it to the vegetable pan to cook slightly more.	48
308	Meanwhile, melt a tablespoon of butter in a pan on medium heat. Add the garlic and chile flakes. Let them sizzle for 30 seconds to a minute, then add the zucchini. Stir the vegetables to coat them. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until some of the water has cooked off and the veggies are tender when stabbed with a fork. Young summer zucchini doesn't need much cooking. Add the lemon zest. Stir!	48
309	Drain the cooked fettuccine and add it to the zucchini pan along with the rest of the butter, the cream, and most of the Romano cheese. Toss the fettuccine around the pan to get everything mixed. Add salt to taste and lots of freshly ground pepper. Top with a bit more cheese and serve immediately.	48
310	Melt the butter in a pot on medium high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally until translucent. Sprinkle the onion with 1/2 tsp salt. This will help it cook evenly and release its juices. Add the garlic and cook for another five minutes, until everything is soft and a light brown. Add a little water to the pot if the onions are sticking to the bottom too much.	49
311	Add the ginger and curry powder and stir. (Tip: Keep your ginger in the freezer, it makes it really easy to grate and add to dishes like this.) Add some more salt to taste. Add the the pureed tomato and cook for about five minutes until the tomato is cooked and begins to separate from the butter (you can see this around the edges of the pan usually).	49
312	Add the lentils and water and bring the stew to a boil. Turn the heat down to low and let it simmer with a lid slightly askew for 20 to 30 minutes until the lentils are cooked through. Add the spinach and stir until it is wilted and incorporated. Cook for about 5 more minutes if using frozen. If using fresh once the spinach is wilted it's ready.	49
313	Taste the stew and add salt and fresh cilantro or any other seasonings according to your taste.	49
314	Put a pot on medium heat and add the butter or oil. Once it’s hot, add the onion. Let it cook, stirring occasionally, until it’s translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another minute until it smells great.	50
315	Add the cumin seeds, stir,  and cook for another minute. Add the jalapeño, ginger, turmeric, coriander and smoked paprika and stir (If using the curry powder instead of the the spices just add it all at once now and stir).	50
316	Add the sweet potato, then stir until everything is coated and mingled. Add enough broth (and coconut milk if using) to cover the vegetables. Bring it to a boil and turn the heat down until the soup is just simmering.	50
317	Let the soup cook until the sweet potato is soft and tender, about 20 minutes. Taste the broth. Season it with salt, pepper, and any other spice you think it needs more of. Here is the time to add the peanut butter if you want it.	50
318	Once seasoned to your liking, take the soup off the heat and purée it with an immersion blender or let it cool to room temperature and use a food processor or blender.	50
319	Serve with freshly chopped cilantro or green onions as\r\nwell as a dollop of sour cream.	50
375	When you see lovely watermelons, honeydews, and cantaloupes on sale, buy them up. Eat half, then cube and freeze the other half. When you want a quick dessert or smoothie, pull out a bag of frozen melon and whip this up.	59
376	Add all the ingredients to a food processor or blender  and process until just smooth. Don't blend too much, or the sorbet will become oversoft. Serve immediately or stick it into the freezer to enjoy later.	59
322	Sauté the onion and garlic in the same pan, with the sausage drippings. Once the onion turns translucent, add the cabbage and sauté for 5 to 7 minutes, until tender enough to jab easily with a fork. Season generously with salt and pepper.	51
377	In a small bowl, mix together all the ingredients using one clean hand. It should form a fairly moist dough. Knead until smooth and form into a ball. Cover with a damp towel or paper towel and set aside for 10 minutes to an hour.	60
378	Divide the dough into 16 small balls.	60
430	A few at a time, take the shrimp and dredge them in the flour. Next, transfer them to the egg mixture. Cover the shrimp lightly with egg mixture, being careful to shake off any excess egg. Then transfer to the cornmeal mixture and coat them evenly.	66
431	Frying in batches of approximately 10, gently place the cornmeal coated shrimp into the hot oil and cook undisturbed for 2 to 3 minutes, until the batter is crispy and golden brown on one side. Flip the shrimp using tongs and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.	66
618	Mix all the ingredients into a pot and heat on the stove until the beans are warmed through. Give it a stir and serve. Or do it all in the microwave, it works just as well!	95
321	Melt the butter in a large pan over medium heat. Slice the casing off the sausage and crumble the raw meat into the pan. I used fresh chorizo because it’s easy to find in my neighborhood and I love the spicy, smoky flavor, but you should use whatever your favorite is. A sweet Italian sausage would taste great too. Sauté the meat until it’s no longer pink, then move it to a large bowl.	51
323	While the cabbage cooks, mix the rice and lentils into the sausage bowl. Add salt, pepper, and any other spices you’d like. I’d suggest repeating whatever spices are in the sausage: in the case of chorizo, that was paprika, cumin, and dried chilies, but if you were using Italian sausage, you might add some fennel seeds. Make sure you taste the mixture as you season it. If both parts of the casserole are tasty, you’ll end up with a delicious meal. If they aren’t seasoned well, it’ll be bland.	51
324	Lightly oil a large casserole dish. Spread the lentil-rice-sausage mixture into an even layer. Next, spread the cabbage mixture on top. Then, as evenly as possible, pour the puréed tomatoes over top. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.	51
325	Bake until hot and bubbly, approximately 30 minutes.	51
326	Set the oven to 375 F.	52
327	Line two cookie trays with parchment or a silicone baking mat or simply grease the tray. Just do something to make sure the cookies don't stick!	52
328	In a large bowl cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy using an electric mixer or a wooden spoon.	52
329	In a separate bowl measure out the flour, cocoa powder, salt and baking soda.	52
330	Add the eggs to the butter/sugar mixture one at a time, mixing after each addition. Add the orange zest and stir.	52
331	Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and stir until you have a smooth dough. Add the chocolate chips and stir until combined.	52
332	If you have time, place the cookie dough in the fridge for an hour. Otherwise just start baking.	52
333	Dollop 6 heaping tablespoon-size globs of dough onto each cookie tray. Make sure you leave lots of room in between each glob because these cookies melt and expand.	52
334	Bake for 10 minutes. Leave on the tray to cool for about 5 minutes. They are quite soft when they first come out and can be hard to move, but they will crisp up and you want them to stay gooey in the middle. Remove them from the tray and let them cool on a wire wrack.	52
335	Continue to bake them in batches until you have used up all the cookie dough.	52
336	Try to enjoy these within 1 to 3 days of baking. They do not age well.	52
337	Mix the rub ingredients together. Apply liberally to the pork shoulder, pressing it gently into the meat until you've covered every side. Set any leftover rub aside for later. Place the pork shoulder in a large pot with a tight lid or a Dutch oven. Cover with a towel or lid and leave in the fridge for a few hours or overnight.	53
338	Pour enough water into the pot to cover the bottom. This will keep the juices from burning. Put the lid on and place the pot in a 200 F oven for 10 to 12 hours. I find it's easier if I cook the pork overnight and pull it out in the morning, but you can put it in early in the morning and have it ready for dinner as well.	53
339	The supposed rule is that cooking takes 1.5 to 2 hours per pound of pork, but I find it usually takes a little longer than that. You are waiting for the internal temperature to reach 200 F. The meat is edible at 160 F, but at higher temperatures the tough connective tissues break down to create the flavor and texture that make pulled pork a delicious and unique treat.	53
340	If you don't have a meat thermometer, figuring out the internal temperature is obviously difficult, but you can test it by feel. Poke the meat with a finger: when it's so soft that it falls apart on its own, take it out of the oven.	53
379	Sprinkle a countertop with flour and place one piece of dough in the middle. Cover the ball with flour on all sides so that it doesn’t stick to the surface, then gently roll it out with a rolling pin (or a bottle if you’re in a pinch) until it’s thin and flat, about 1/8” thick. As you roll the dough, be sure to unstick it from your counter and flip it over. To make it round, roll straight in front of you, then turn the dough 90 degrees and roll out again.	60
380	Place a non-stick skillet on medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add the roti and cook until the dough lifts away from the pan around the edges and small bubbles form. Flip the bread over and cook the other side. Usually it goes very quickly. You want to see light-brown bubbles all over the dough. Don’t let it get too dark, though, as this will make the roti too crunchy to use for rolls. Repeat this process until you’re finished with the dough.	60
381	Once you have practiced, you can roll out one roti while another cooks in the pan to make the process quicker.	60
382	Keep them under a towel on the counter or in a warm oven until ready to serve.	60
663	Put a skillet on medium heat and add the ghee or butter. (Ghee, which is traditional in Indian cooking, is just butter with the milk solids removed, and it can withstand higher temperatures than butter without burning.)	105
664	Once the butter is hot, add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for 5 seconds before adding the diced onion. Let the onion cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.	105
665	In a small bowl, mix the garlic, ginger, turmeric, coriander, cayenne powder, salt, and 1 tablespoon of water.	105
666	Add the spices to the onion mixture and mix, cooking for another 2 minutes. It will smell strongly aromatic. This step is important because the spices become toasted and release their flavor.	105
667	Next, add the potatoes. Stir to coat them with the onions and spices. Add about a cup of water and cover the pan with a lid. Let it cook for about 10 minutes, checking occasionally to stir and make sure nothing is burning. Add more water as needed. You want the final mixture to be only a bit moist, but the water helps everything cook evenly.	105
668	Test the potatoes with a fork: if you can easily pierce them, they’re ready. Once they are, add the kale and stir until the kale is wilted. Taste and add more salt if needed.	105
669	To assemble the rolls, scoop 1/8 of the mixture into the center of a roti, distributing it in an even line. Roll it up.	105
383	Freeze the stick of butter for 20 to 30 minutes.	61
670	Serve two roti per person with cilantro and a generous dollop of raita, either over the top or on the side.	105
671	Turn the oven to 500 °F.	106
384	While the butter chills, add the flour and salt to a bowl and stir briefly to combine.	61
385	Using the largest grater section of your box grater (just the basic cheese one not the super fine one) grate the stick of butter.	61
386	As quickly as you can, add the butter curls into the bowl with the flour and mix it up just a bit with your fingers, covering the frozen butter with flour. Working quickly, pour the quarter cup of water into the bowl and use your fingers to bring the dough together roughly. Work as quickly as you can mixing it, but try not to break up the butter too much. You want to have bits of butter popping throughout the pastry — that’s what creates flakiness. If it's still just too dry add another Tbsp of water.	61
387	Finally, dump the rough dough out onto a clean countertop and bring it together into a rough disc shape with your hands. Cover it tightly with plastic wrap and leave in the fridge for an hour or overnight if you are making it the next day.	61
388	After an hour, remove the dough from your fridge and let it rest on the counter for 5 minutes so you can roll it our more easily.	61
390	Sprinkle a clean counter liberally with flour. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough straight in front of you. Once you have rolled a couple of times, pick up the dough and flip it over. Then rotate the dough 90 degrees. Roll out the dough another couple of times. Flipping it and rotating it will keep it from sticking to the countertop and help you make an even circle. Sprinkle more flour onto the counter if anything gets sticky. Don’t be shy with the flour! Repeat this process until you have a large enough circle of dough to fit your pie dish (I use a 9 inch dish here), with some excess. You want to have pastry that is hanging over the edge of the pie plate, because it helps create a nice edge and lets you fix any mistakes you make.	61
391	Transfer the dough to a 9 inch pie dish and press it gently in place. You want about an inch of excess pastry hanging all the way around the rim. Trim away any pieces that are longer. Use your fingers in a pinching motion to roll excess dough up to create an edge on the lip of the pie plate. Squish this down with your fingers or a fork to create a rim around the lip of the pie. Alternatively, use a pinching motion to crimp the edge. If you are a but mystified by this process just do a google search and you can find lots of tutorials on youtube!	61
392	Refrigerate the pie dough while you make the filling.	61
393	To make the filling add the eggs to a bowl and whisk quickly to break up the yolks. Next add the pumpkin puree and sugar and whisk again. Add the salt, zest and all the spices and whisk again. Finally add the whipped cream and slowly and carefully whisk it into the thicker mixture. You only need to be careful here so you don't splash cream on yourself. Once the filling is smooth and even you're done!	61
394	Take the prepared pie crust out of the fridge and gently pour the filling into the crust.	61
395	Carefully place the pie in the oven and bake for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes check the pie. If it is still wiggly and wet in the middle leave it for another 5 to 15 minutes. I find it needs 50 minutes to an hour total, but some ovens are crazy so check it at 45 just in case. If you aren't sure if it's too wet, remove it from the oven and test with a toothpick or knife, if it comes out mostly dry (you may get moisture on it, but no clumps—it's a custard pie after all, you do want some moisture!) it's ready.	61
396	Once the filling is no longer jiggly, pull it out of the oven and let it cool to room temperature (this usually takes 1 to 2 hours).	61
397	Once the pie is cool prepare the whipped cream. In a large bowl or stand mixer add the whipping cream, sugar and zest or cinnamon. Whip it with a whisk, or electric mixer until soft peaks form. Taste the cream and if you think it needs a little more sugar, zest or cinnamon add it now. Whip it a few more times until it's a consistency where if you drop it off the spoon it stays fairly well in place rather than oozing out.	61
398	Spread the whipped cream over the top of the cooled pie in a nice even layer, or in dollops, whatever way you like. Sprinkle with more cinnamon or orange zest if you like. Serve immediately or leave in the fridge until ready to serve.	61
399	In a large, non-aluminum pan, stir together the vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, pepper, and bay leaves. Add the chicken, coating each piece thoroughly. Cover and let marinate for at least 30 minutes, but overnight is great.	62
400	Pull the chicken out of the marinade and pat each piece dry.	62
401	Pour the oil into a large pot on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add enough chicken to fill the bottom of the pot. Let it cook for a few minutes, until one side of the chicken is browned, then flip it over. When the first batch of chicken is done, remove it from the pot and repeat with the remainder.	62
402	After all the chicken is browned, put it back in the pot along with the marinade, water, potatoes, and carrots. Turn the heat up until the liquid comes to a boil, then reduce to low heat and simmer for 45 minutes, or until the meat near the bone is no longer pink and the carrots and potatoes are cooked through.	62
403	About 20 minutes before the adobo is ready, pour the rice into a medium pot with 4 cups of water. Add two pinches of salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat with the lid off. Turn the heat down and cover with a lid that is slightly askew to let the steam escape. Cook about 20 minutes, until the water is all gone.	62
676	Once the crust is the desired shape and thickness, dust the back of a cookie sheet with flour or cornmeal to keep the crust from sticking, then place it the dough on the sheet.	106
389	Set the oven to 425 degrees F.	110
713	Once the filling is no longer jiggly, pull it out of the oven and let it cool to room temperature. Once it's cool enough, transfer it to the fridge to chill for 2 hours or overnight.	110
714	15 minutes before serving, add the cream, sugar and cinnamon to a bowl and whisk until stiff peaks form.	110
715	Slice the pie into pieces and serve with a dollop of cinnamon-whipped cream on top. Enjoy your hard work!	110
409	Once you've rolled out one or two tortillas, put a non-stick or cast iron pan on medium-high heat. Let it get nice and hot. Place a tortilla in the pan. Once it starts to dry up around the edges, flip it over with a spatula, then gently press it down to give it some color underneath. Once the tortilla has brown spots on both sides, remove it from the pan and continue with the next. Work quickly! As you wait for each tortilla to cook, roll out more. You'll get better at this part with practice.	63
410	If you're serving the tortillas soon, place them in a warm oven to keep them pliable. If they're for later in the day, pile them under a cloth while you finish making them. Once you're done, wrap them in aluminum foil and put them in the fridge. Heat in the oven before serving.	63
411	Chop each onion in half lengthwise, peel them, then cut them into half moon slices. These big slices are ideal since you're cooking the onions for so long and creating creamy ribbons of onion. Slice the garlic as well.	64
412	Melt the butter in a large pot on medium heat. Add the onions, garlic, and bay leaves. Cover the pot with a lid and leave it for 10 minutes. When you come back, the onions should have released a lot of moisture. Give them a stir. Pour in the vinegar and put the lid back on.	64
413	Cook for 1 hour, stirring every 20 minutes. When the onions at the bottom start to stick and turn dark, add a splash of water to unstick them. Don't worry, the onions aren't burning, just caramelizing. The water helps lift off the sticky, delicious, sweet part!	64
414	Once the onions are very dark and about a quarter the volume they once were, add all the water and a bunch of salt and pepper. Cover the pot again, turn the heat down to low, and let it simmer for another hour. Taste and adjust salt and pepper as needed.	64
415	Ladle the soup into bowls.	64
416	Now it’s time to make cheese toast! If you want classic French onion soup— with the toast directly in the soup, which makes it a bit soggy—place a piece of bread on top of each bowl of soup, sprinkle with cheese, then heat the bowls under your oven’s broiler until the cheese is bubbly.	64
417	If you don’t like soggy toast, just make the cheese toast on its own and serve it on the side to dunk.	64
418	Put the flour in a bowl. Make a crater in the center of the flour and crack the egg into it. Mix with your hands. The egg takes a while to release all its moisture, so don’t panic if things are dry at first. If, after mixing for about a minute, the dough still seems excessively dry, add a teaspoon of water. Keep mixing until you develop a stiff dough that is quite dry. The dryness makes it easier to roll out and keeps the noodles from sticking together when you cook them.	65
419	Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl covered with a moist towel or plastic wrap for 1 or 2 hours. Here is a photo of it before resting.	65
420	Once an hour or more has passed, you’ll notice a marked change in the dough. Now that the egg has released its moisture, you’ll have a pale yellow, smooth, pliable dough. Knead again to create a smooth ball.	65
421	Tear or slice the dough into manageable pieces—usually as many as the number of people you’re feeding. Dust your countertop or cutting board heavily with flour, then use a rolling pin to make the dough as thin as you can. Rolling it out will take a while because it’s tough and stretchy. Try to get it thin enough to see light through. The thinner the dough, the quicker it will cook, but don’t make the dough so thin that it tears.	65
422	By the time the pasta is rolled out, it should be dry enough to avoid sticking to itself. If it’s still moist, leave it to sit for a few minutes.	65
423	Slice into whatever size of noodles you like. It’s easy to make the noodles a consistent size if you fold the dough over itself a few times first. Shake the cut noodles on a tray with a bit of flour to keep them from sticking.	65
424	Boil in heavily salted water. Fresh pasta cooks in as little as 30 seconds if the noodles are thin. It’s ready when it changes color and starts to float.	65
425	You can keep uncooked pasta for up to 2 days in the fridge.	65
672	Put a large pan on medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the potato slices evenly to the pan, making sure each slice is touching the bottom. (If you slice them thin enough, they’ll turn out almost like little chips.)	106
673	Let them cook until they start to crinkle around the edges and turn brown. Flip them over and brown the other side, then move them to a bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then toss with your hands (after they cool down!) to make sure they’re evenly coated.	106
674	Heat up another tablespoon of oil in the same pan, then toss in the leek slices, stirring occasionally until they’re soft, about 5 minutes. Toss them with the potato slices and add a bit more salt and pepper.	106
675	Clear a space on the counter and sprinkle with flour. Divide your dough into 4 equal pieces. One at a time, stretch the doughs into crusts. You can use a rolling pin or just slowly use your fingers and hands. I like to make mine really thin and big, but it’s up to you how thick\r\nto make it.	106
677	Now layer it with ¼ of the potato and leek mixture and ¼ of the shredded mozzarella. Bake for 5 to 8 minutes. If it’s your first time, simply keep an eye on the oven to see when the pizza’s done. The crust should be light brown and the cheese melted.	106
678	Repeat the process until you’ve baked all your pizzas. If your oven is big enough, you can of course do more than one pizza at a time.	106
426	If using frozen shrimp make sure the shrimp are fully defrosted. Remove shells and devein if the shrimp if you haven't bought them that way.	66
427	Now set up your breading station! On one plate, spread out the flour. Crack the egg into a bowl, add the milk, and beat lightly with a fork. On another plate, spread the cornmeal, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne, dried thyme, dried oregano, salt and black pepper and mix them up with your fingers.	66
428	Warm the 1/4 cup of oil in a large skillet on medium heat. Use 1/4 cup or enough to generously cover the bottom of the pan.	66
429	Set out a cookie sheet and line it with paper towel.	66
679	Set the oven to 400 °F.	114
432	Once the shrimp are golden brown and crispy on both sides, gently transfer them from the pan to the prepared sheet pan with paper towel to drain their excess oil. Repeat this process until you have cooked all your shrimp.	66
433	Turn your oven to it's "warm" setting, or about 175 F. Leave the sheet pan with fried shrimp in the warm oven while you prepare the rest of the ingredients for the sandwich.	66
434	To make the sauce simply mix the mayonnaise, mustard and hot sauce together quickly with a spoon and set aside.	66
435	Slice each bread roll down the side leaving the very ends uncut so that you create a nice pocket to fill with shrimp. Slather each roll with sauce on one side and then stuff in a layer of lettuce, tomato and pickle. Finally stuff the sandwich with as much shrimp as you can fit. I could barely manage six per sandwich, but if you can do more, go for it! Drizzle with more sauce and add more tomato, pickles or lettuce to your taste and serve.	66
436	If you have time, freeze the ginger root for an hour before you start. It’s much easier to grate when frozen! Store the rest of the root in the freezer until the next time you need it.	67
437	Drop the grated ginger root and garlic into a pot over medium heat. A few seconds later, once you can start to smell the garlic, pour in the water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low.	67
438	Add the mushrooms, chile paste, soy sauce, and toasted sesame oil. Place a lid on the pot and let simmer for 20 minutes.	67
439	Separate the white and green parts of the scallions. You’ll cook the white and save the green to sprinkle over the soup.	67
440	Cut the tofu into four slices, then turn each slice into eight\r\nsquares. Or just chop it up however you like.	67
441	Add the tofu, carrots, and the white parts of the scallions to the broth. Cook about 10 minutes more, until the carrots are tender.	67
442	Add the noodles and keep boiling until they soften, usually just a few minutes, although it depends on the type of noodles.	67
443	Taste the broth. If it isn’t salty enough, splash in more soy\r\nsauce. Adjust the sesame oil and chili paste to your taste as well.	67
444	Ladle the soup into bowls. For a little crunch, top with bean sprouts and the green bits of the scallions. Add any other additions you like.	67
445	If you have leftovers, you’ll find you like this soup even more the next day. Overnight, the flavors will infuse into the tofu, as well as combining with each other. You might want to store the noodles separately, though, because otherwise they’ll get soggy.	67
680	Pour 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil onto a baking sheet.\r\nSpread the oil around, then spread out the sticks of sliced potato. Pour the rest of the oil over the top and\r\nsprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Use your hands to ensure the potatoes are coated with oil, salt,\r\nand pepper, and evenly spread across the pan. Place\r\nthem in the oven and bake for 20 minutes.	107
681	Meanwhile, prepare the gravy. Melt the butter in a\r\nsaucepan on medium heat. Add the shallot and garlic.\r\nLet them cook for 2 minutes until translucent, but not\r\nbrown. Add the flour and quickly stir with a spoon.\r\nAdd a little broth if gets too clumpy.	107
446	Add the apple cider and 1 apple worth of pieces (with peel!) to a pot and place it on the stovetop on medium high heat. The cider here is not the boozy kind, if your farmers market doesn't sell it then use unfiltered apple juice. Set the other 1/2 apple aside for later. Eat the other half!	68
447	Bring the mixture to a boil and then bring the heat down to medium, letting it gently boil for about 30 minutes.	68
448	Turn the oven to 375 F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, or use silicone mats if you have them. Lightly butter the parchment paper.	68
449	While the mixture boils, prepare your other ingredients. In a small bowl add the flour, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Stir it to combine.	68
450	Once the apple cider has boiled for 30 minutes, remove it from the heat. The amount of liquid should have reduced by more than half and the apple should be soft. Blend the mixture in a food processor or with a handheld blender. Pour the pureed mixture into a measuring cup. It should measure approximately 1 cup. If there is too much, pour the mixture back into the pot and let it cook for a few more minutes until it has reduced to about a cup of liquid. If it is less than a cup add a bit more apple cider until it reaches a cup.	68
454	Prepare the glaze by simply whisking the ingredients together in a medium sized bowl.	68
682	Let the mixture cook until it turns light brown. Add the\r\nvegetable broth, soy sauce, and cayenne pepper. Bring\r\nthe gravy to a boil, then turn down the heat and let it\r\ncook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste it,\r\nadding salt and pepper as needed. Turn down the heat to very low, just enough to keep the gravy warm until the fries come out of the oven.	107
683	Dice the mozzarella.	107
684	After the fries have baked for 20 minutes, remove them\r\nfrom the oven. Lift them with a spatula and test their\r\ntenderness with a fork. If it goes through easily, the fries\r\nare ready. If you want them a little more crispy, flip\r\nthem over and put them back in the over for a few more\r\nminutes.	107
685	Once they’re done, pile one layer of fries onto a plate.\r\nTop with cheese and then the hot gravy. Repeat with a\r\nsecond layer before sprinkling with scallions and more\r\nfreshly ground black pepper.	107
686	Bring molasses, honey, water, cinnamon stick, cloves and ginger to a boil and stir to make sure the molasses and honey has dissolved. Turn off the heat and let it cool to room temperature. Store in the fridge overnight to let the spices infuse.	108
687	The next day, add the salt and vanilla and stir. Pour it into a jar.	108
688	To make one drink, pour one tablespoon (or shot!) of the syrup in a glass over ice. Top with 1/4 cup of seltzer, (or to taste) and a squeeze of lime if using. I'd suggest making the drinks one at a time to your taste rather than mixing the syrup with the seltzer all at once. There is something ritualistic about mixing up a little drink for yourself so make it part of the experience.	108
689	Measure out the flour, yeast, brown sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, cloves and salt into a large bowl.	109
796	Slice the tofu in half lengthwise. Slice each half like you would a loaf of bread, about 6 to 8 pieces, depending on how thick you want them.	126
815	Place your cookie sheet with green beans under the broiler. Watch it carefully. You want the green beans to soften and cook and the coconut to get nicely browned, but not burnt. Use an oven mitt and occasionally move the cookie sheet to make sure that the beans and coconut are getting evenly toasted. It will be fast! It took my broiler about 2 minutes to cook the beans and toast the coconut.	128
451	In a large pot add the butter and apple mixture and bring it to a boil on medium heat. Once it is boiling rapidly add the flour mixture to it and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon. Mix for 1 to 2 minutes. It should be very smooth with a little of the dough sticking to the bottom of the pan.	68
452	Take the pan off the heat and add the dough into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. You can also just keep doing it by hand if you choose. Add the eggs one at a time, making sure each egg is thoroughly mixed before you add the next egg. At first the dough will separate, but don't panic, it will come back together as you add more eggs. Once all the eggs are added, the dough should be smooth, glossy and light. Add the other half apple worth of apple pieces and gently stir them into the dough until they are just incorporated.	68
453	Quickly spoon out the dough onto your prepared baking sheets. They might look a little messy, but that's okay. Leave about an inch between each spoonful of dough. Pop them into the oven and set the timer for 20 minutes. You will probably not fit them all in at once so leave the dough on the counter covered with a tea towel between batches.	68
455	Check the puffs after 20 minutes to see if they are evenly golden brown. Sometimes they require a few more minutes so don't be afraid to leave them in a little longer, up to 25 minutes.	68
456	Take the puffs out of the oven and quickly remove them from the pans, dunking them straight into the glaze. Roll them over in the glaze to evenly coat and then let the excess glaze drip off. Place each puff onto a cooling rack. If you like, sprinkle them with a little sugar and cinnamon. Enjoy while hot!	68
457	If starting from a whole chicken, cut the chicken into 8 pieces. You should have 2 breasts, 2 thighs, 2 legs and 2 wings. If you need a little tutorial for cutting a whole chicken give Melissa Clark's lovely video a watch. Or if you prefer to buy your chicken already cut up, that is just fine too, but the whole thing is usually the best value.	69
458	Since you don't have a use for the back of the chicken here, keep it to make chicken stock or gravy later.	69
459	In a large bowl or tupperware add the chicken pieces. Add the rest of the ingredients and mix everything up with your hands making sure everything is well covered. Leave for an hour or overnight in the fridge.	69
460	When ready to cook, set the oven to 425 F.	69
461	Line a baking tray with parchment paper or aluminum foil and place each piece of chicken down skin-side up.	69
462	Roast until chicken is brown and cooked through. Check the breasts after 20 minutes, but they may take up to 30. The wings and legs will take up to 40. Remove each piece from the tray as it becomes cooked and continue cooking the rest. (If you are using all thighs or all breasts obviously adjust the cooking time based on the length of time needed to cook each cut.) You can cook them for the full 40 and they should be just fine, you only need to take them out earlier if you are obsessed with getting them at their juiciest. Which you should be!	69
463	Enjoy the chicken with rice, a big salad or anything else you'd serve chicken with!	69
464	Cut the tofu into 1/4 inch cubes. Dump them into a plastic sandwich bag or a tupperware container and pour the soy sauce over the tofu. Shake it up. Leave it for 1 hour in the fridge or for several hours overnight or while you're at work.	70
465	Place a cast iron skillet on medium high heat. Add the butter, let it melt and swirl it around the pan to coat. Add the tofu to the pan and shake it so that most of the cubes are laying flat against the pan. Let them cook untouched for 2 minutes. Flip them or toss and shake the pan around. Continue to do this until the tofu cubes are nicely brown on 2 to 3 sides.	70
466	Meanwhile mix up the ingredients for the sauce in a small bowl.	70
467	Add the cauliflower to the pan along with 1/2 cup of water. Leave it for 2 minutes. Toss and let it cook another 2 minutes or until the water as cooked off. Add the sauce and another 1/4 cup of water to the pan and coat everything. Let it cook, tossing occasionally until all the water is cooked off and the cauliflower can be easily pierced with a fork. Let it cook for another minute so you can get some nice crispy caramelization on the tofu and cauliflower. Taste a piece of tofu and a piece of cauliflower. If it needs more salt or spice then add soy sauce or gochujang. If it seems tasty and cooked enough turn off the heat and add the scallions. Toss it all together and serve.	70
468	Serve on its own, or on a bed of rice or noodles. This dish keeps well in a sealed container for 2 to 3 days.	70
469	The ginger syrup here is from the homemade ginger ale recipe so go make that first.	71
470	In a glass, mix the ginger syrup with the grapefruit juice with a long spoon. Top with the seltzer and ice.	71
471	Add the cucumbers, red pepper, black olives, feta, lemon juice and a pinch of salt to a mixing bowl and toss it together. Feel totally free to use more or less of any vegetable. This is completely to taste so use more vegetables if you want a noodle bowl really jammed with veggies.	72
472	Add the noodles you made earlier and toss everything together.	72
473	Add the olive oil to a large pot or dutch oven on medium heat. Let the oil get hot, then add the onion. Once the onion starts to sizzle, turn the heat down a bit. Cook over low heat for about 10 minutes, until the onions are light brown and slightly caramelized.	73
474	Add the garlic and jalapeno and cook for another minute. Add the cumin seeds, oregano, cayenne, salt and pepper.	73
475	Add the beans and broth. Bring everything to a boil, then turn the heat down to low. Put a lid on the pot and let it cook for 45 minutes to an hour. Stir occasionally to make sure that nothing sticks.	73
478	Serve the chili with finely chopped scallions or a bit of cilantro on top and some nice crusty bread on the side.	73
696	Pre-heat the oven to 350 F.	109
479	Spread 1/4 cup of green chilies evenly over one tortilla. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of cheese over the chilies, then top with half the cilantro. Place another tortilla on top of each prepared tortilla to form a quesadilla. Repeat!	74
480	Place a large, non-stick pan on medium heat. Once it’s hot, add a quesadilla and toast for about 1 minute. Flip it over and brown the second side, then do the same for the other quesadilla. Slice into triangles and enjoy with some fresh salsa and sour cream.	74
481	In a small pot cover the eggs with cold water. Bring the eggs to a simmer on medium heat. Once the water begins to boil, turn off the heat and put a lid on the pot. Set a timer for 7 minutes and leave the eggs in the pot. Once the 7 minutes are over, drain the hot water and pour cold water over the eggs to stop all cooking. Leave the eggs for 5 minutes.	75
482	While you let the eggs cool completely, add the celery, green chilies, scallions, dijon and mayo to a bowl.	75
483	Time to peel the eggs! Dry them off a bit and roll them gently across your countertop to crackle the surface. Once it's all crackled, start at the bottom of the egg and gently peel off the shell. This should make it easier to do smoothly. Repeat with all the eggs.	75
484	Once the eggs are free of shell, chop them into quarters and then roughly chop them. Add the chopped egg to the bowl with the other ingredients and add the salt and pepper. Mix it up and taste. Add more salt or other ingredients to your taste. I don't like much mayo so you may want to add a bit more if you like is slooshier.	75
485	Top your toast or make a sandwich or save for later. It should keep for a week or so sealed in a container in the fridge.	75
486	In a large pan or dutch oven melt the butter on medium heat. Add the garlic and scallions and saute for just a minute until you can smell them.	76
487	Add the spinach to the pan and stir to coat in the butter and garlic. Place a lid on the pan to allow the spinach to steam for 2 to 3 minutes.	76
488	Next add the dill and mint, and a sprinkling of salt and stir. The spinach should be wilted and greatly reduced in volume. The spinach will release some water as it cooks and you'll want to try to cook off as much of this water as possible. Taste it and add more salt if needed.	76
489	Once the spinach doesn't look too watery it's time to cook the eggs! Make 4 indents, one in each corner of the pan.	76
490	Crack the eggs, one at a time into a bowl. Pour each egg into your prepared indents. Sprinkle them with salt and pepper and place the lid on top for about 2 minutes, until the whites of the eggs are fully cooked but the yolks are still nice and runny.	76
491	While your eggs cook prepare your toast your bread or  pita so it's hot and ready when the eggs are cooked.	76
492	Take the shakshuka off the heat and drizzle yogurt over the top. Alternatively you can serve it and drizzle the yogurt over each bowl.	76
493	Serve in bowls with the toast or pita and enjoy!	76
690	In a small saucepan or the microwave, warm the milk and butter until the butter is just melted. Add the milk mixture to a second bowl along with the pumpkin puree and egg. Whisk until smooth.	109
691	Slowly add the wet mixture to the dry mixture, mixing as you go with a wooden spoon or your hand. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl as you go. Add a bit more flour if the dough is too sticky to form a smooth, round ball.	109
494	In a small pot add the brown rice, water, 1 Tbsp butter and ½ tsp salt. Bring it to a boil on medium heat with the lid on. When the water begins to boil turn the heat down to the lowest setting until it’s just simmering. Place the lid slightly askew and cook for 45 minutes.	77
495	While the rice cooks you can prepare the rest of the meal at a leisurely pace. Mix 1 tsp salt, cumin, oregano, cayenne and pepper in a small bowl. Sprinkle half the spice mixture over the fillets, coating on both sides. You will use the other half of the spices later during cooking. Set them aside.	77
496	Cut the avocado in half and remove the pit. While still in the peel, slice the avocado lengthwise and then widthwise a few times. Use a spoon to scoop the avocado flesh out into a bowl. Sprinkle with salt to taste and half the juice of a lime and mash with a fork until it's as smooth or chunky as you like. Taste and add more salt and lime juice. This is your very simple guacamole!	77
499	When the rice has been cooking for 45 minutes, turn off the heat and take the lid off the pot. Use a spoon or fork to fluff the rice up a bit and then put the lid back on for 2 minutes to steam a bit.	77
619	Serve with rice, or just in a bowl. For an English-style breakfast, try spreading the beans over toast. Or throw them into a burrito, or scramble them with eggs, or stir-fry with onions and bell pepper.	95
620	Cook according to package instructions. Drain the water and sprinkle with a generous amount of oil to keep them from sticking. Approximately 2 Tbsp works for me, but you may need a little more or less. Do what makes sense to you. I like udon or soba noodles, but spaghetti works great. Store them in a sealed container in the fridge.	96
621	Honestly, after a night in the fridge they will usually be a little stuck together. It seems unavoidable. But also who cares? Just try your best and they should come apart once you are tossing them in the dressing and vegetables even if they are a bit sticky at first. Okay, that's done. On to the fun part!	96
622	Put a pot of water on high heat and add a good shake of salt. Bring it to a boil and cook the pasta according to the package instructions.	97
623	While the water is coming to a boil, splash the olive oil into a wide pan on medium-high heat. Let it get hot. Add the eggplant cubes and sprinkle them with salt, then cook for about 5 minutes. If the eggplant starts to look too dry, add a bit of water. Once the cubes are a little brown on all sides, add the garlic and chile flakes and stir. Add the tomatoes and cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Again, if it looks too dry, add a bit of water. Everything will shrink up and become a sort of loose, thick sauce. Add half the cheese and half the basil, if you have it.	97
624	Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it to the saucepan. Toss everything together, then turn off the heat. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve it in bowls sprinkled with more Romano and Basil.	97
497	In a medium pan on medium heat, melt a Tbsp of butter. Add the onion and poblano strips and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent and you have a few brown spots on the poblanos. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Add salt to taste, about ½ tsp. Remove the vegetables from the heat and spoon them into a bowl.	77
498	Clean the pan and put it back on high heat with another tablespoon of butter. When the butter is melted, swirl it around the pan. When the pan is hot, add the cod fillets to the pan and let them cook undisturbed for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook for another 2 minutes. They should be brown and crispy on both sides. Using a spatula, gently break up the fish into flaky pieces. Add the vegetable mixture back into the pan and stir. Sprinkle the rest of the spice blend over the everything in the pan, mix and cook for another 2 minutes until warmed through. Set aside until the rice is finished cooking.	77
500	Add the chopped cilantro or basil and lime juice into the rice and mix. Taste and add more cilantro, lime juice or salt to your taste. Done! Now time to assemble.	77
501	If you want to make burritos: Place your tortilla on a clean cutting board. Scoop ¼ or ⅓ of the rice onto the tortilla (depending on how many you are feeding and appetites!). Top with ¼ or ⅓ of the fish and vegetable mixture and finally with a dollop of guacamole. Fold the ends of the burrito in toward the centre and roll it up like a carpet. Slice it in half to serve or keep it whole.	77
502	For a bowl: Same instructions as above, but scoop into a bowl instead of a burrito. Top with a little chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lime if you have it.	77
503	You can use almost any vegetable to make these burger patties, except lettuce and other greens that won't stand up to cooking. If you pick a hard vegetable like\r\npotato, squash, or eggplant, you’ll need to cook it first.	78
504	Roughly mash the lentils. Make sure the vegetables are either small to begin with (like corn or peas) or finely chopped so that they cook evenly. I went for a bell pepper this time.	78
505	Mix the lentils, veggies, and meat with your hands in a large bowl. If you’re going to barbecue, add an egg to keep them from crumbling when you flip. Season with salt and pepper. Form into 8 patties.	78
506	Grill the patties either on the barbecue or a pan on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Sear until dark brown on one side, then flip ’em and do the same on the other side. If you want cheeseburgers, lay cheese on the patties after flipping them once.	78
507	Serve on toasted buns with your favorite condiments and fresh vegetables. Burgers are a great place to be adventurous!	78
508	If you won’t eat all the burgers at once, wrap the raw patties in plastic. Refrigerate for a few days or freeze for up to 2 weeks.	78
509	Chop up your cucumbers into long pieces. The ones I usually get for making pickles are small and I cut them into 4 to 6 pieces lengthwise. But you prefer smaller "chip" style pickles then cut then that way.	79
510	Pour the vinegar, water, salt, mustard seeds, dill seeds, and any of the other additional whole spices suggested here. Obviously they will change the flavor a bit so consider what you like. Obviously only add the chilies if you want spicy pickles. Bring the brine to a boil on medium heat and turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 10 minutes.	79
511	While the brine simmers, fill the jars with the cucumbers. You will add approximately 1 lb of cucumbers to each jar but sometimes it may be a little less or more. Just fit in as much as you can. If you like, add a few pieces of red onion or shallot, cloves of garlic or sprigs of dill to the jars. They add a bit more flavor and then you get some pickled onions or garlic as well! But these are totally optional.	79
512	Once the brine has simmered for 10 minutes (be sure to put your kitchen fan on during this process as the vinegar smell can get intense and make you cough otherwise) pour the brine over the vegetables in the jars. Fill them up to the brim. It's hard to get this amount just right so you may have some leftover or occasionally you may not have enough. If you don't have enough just boil up another cup of water and vinegar along with a Tbsp of salt and use that to top everything up.	79
513	Once the brine has cooled to room temperature place the lids on the jars and seal them. Leave the pickles in the fridge for 2 weeks. Once 2 weeks is up open and enjoy!	79
514	Slice up the ginger root into medallions.	80
515	In a pot bring the sugar, water and sliced ginger to a boil on medium heat. Once it begins to bubble, turn the heat down to low and simmer for 30 minutes.	80
516	Pour the syrup through a sieve to catch the ginger. You should have about 1 cup of syrup, if it is a bit less than a cup, add water until it is 1 cup so it isn’t too sweet and syrupy.	80
517	To make one drink add 2 Tbsp syrup to a glass and pour ½ cup of seltzer on top. Squeeze a little lime into it. If you want to make a larger quantity, mix all the syrup with the liter of seltzer and squeeze lime to taste in each drink.	80
518	Set the oven at 375 F. Spread peanuts evenly onto a cookie sheet. Pictured are the nuts before going into the oven.	81
519	Roast for 5 to 15 minutes depending on how dark you want them. I roasted mine for about 10 minutes total. When you pull them out of the oven they will be shiny with oil and golden like the ones pictured here. Let them sit on the tray until they are cool to the touch.	81
520	Dump the peanuts into a food processor or blender and add the salt. Grind it! For the first 30 seconds it will be extremely loud. Don't worry, it will quiet down.	81
625	Put a pot of water on the stove and bring to a boil in heavily salted water. Cook spaghetti according to the package instructions.	98
626	Melt butter in a pan on medium heat. Add the garlic and toss until you can smell it. About 2 minutes. Add the frozen peas, and 1/2 cup of water to the pan. Let the peas cook until the water has evaporated, about 5 minutes.	98
627	Add the lemon zest, parsley and Romano cheese and use a spatula or other flat kitchen implement to squish the peas roughly. Taste it and add a bit of salt and freshly ground pepper according to your taste. They don't have to be smooth, but you do want the peas to be squished enough to form a sort of loose pesto that will coat your pasta nicely.	98
628	Once the spaghetti is cooked add it to the pan with the pesto and toss. Add water a few tablespoons at a time to help loosen the sauce so everything is coated.	98
629	Serve hot with extra parsley and grated Romano. Squeeze a little lemon juice on it if you feel like it.	98
630	Serve as is or for a little crunch add some crushed almonds or toasted breadcrumbs.	98
521	Grind for another couple of minutes. It should start to look a little sticky and gummy as the oils release. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of your food processor occasionally just to make sure that every bit is incorporated into the final peanut butter.	81
522	Keep grinding and will start to become a recognizable, chunky peanut butter. But keep going, it will get smoother and looser.	81
523	Grind until it reaches a consistency you like. I would suggest that if you like a chunky peanut butter to keep some peanuts aside at the beginning and then break them up a bit with a knife and simply stir them into your creamy peanut butter. Scoop into a jar and enjoy!	81
524	Slice the sweet potatoes into quarters lengthwise. Cut each piece into half moons.	82
525	In a cast-iron pan on medium heat melt the butter. Add the honey and chipotle and whisk to combine. Add the sweet potatoes and toss to coat. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.	82
526	Place the pan in the oven and bake the potatoes for approximately 20 minutes. Test to see if they are cooked through by piercing them with a knife. If it goes in easily they are done. When you take them out of the oven quickly stir them to make sure all of the glaze ends up on the sweet potatoes rather than wasted in the pan!	82
527	In a heavy-bottomed pot on low heat add the cream, milk, vanilla seeds and bean. Whisk a couple of times and leave it to gently warm for 10 minutes.	83
528	Meanwhile add the honey, salt and eggs to a medium bowl and whisk together.	83
529	In a small bowl whisk together the cornstarch and 3 Tbsp milk. Set aside.	83
530	Once the milk and cream have steeped for 10 minutes fish out the vanilla bean and turn the heat up to medium. Slowly pour the egg/honey mixture into the milk mixture whisking vigorously all the while to incorporate it. Make sure you whisk so the eggs incorporate smoothly and don’t scramble.	83
531	Next, give the cornstarch mixture a quick whisk to make sure it hasn’t settled and add it to the pudding. Whisk a few times just to keep the bottom from sticking. Let the mixture heat until it begins to thicken, this should be the point just before it comes to a boil.	83
532	You can test if it is thick enough by dipping a spoon into it. If it coats the back of the spoon and stays there it is thick enough. Turn off the heat and remove the pot from the stove. Pour the pudding into the bowl you want to serve it in. Let it come to room temperature and then refrigerate for a few hours. It will thicken up further when cool.	83
533	Add fruit and water to a pot and heat on medium until the fruit softens and begins to fall apart. Squish the strawberries with the back of a spoon to break them apart a bit. This will help it cook faster. After about 10 minutes, add the honey and stir to incorporate. Stir occasionally and cook until it is as thick as you want it to be, between 20 and 30 minutes.	83
534	Mix the cornstarch with 1 Tbsp of water so it doesn’t get clumpy and pour it into your compote. Stir until the compote is glossy and thick.	83
535	Turn off the heat and add the ginger and pinch of salt. Stir and taste. Adjust with more salt, ginger or honey to your taste. Let it cool at room temperature.	83
536	To serve, spoon it onto your pudding once the pudding has set just a bit. That way you will have a lovely layer of pudding and a layer of compote. Yum!	83
537	Grind the rice and blanched almonds in a blender with 1/2 cup of water. Break it up enough so the rice is smashed up and the water is milky. It doesn't have to be a paste, you just want pebbles of rice and almonds.	84
538	Dump the mixture into a bowl with 3 more cups of water, the cinnamon, zest and juice of the lime. Cover it with a towel and leave it in the fridge overnight.	84
539	The next day line a strainer with cheese cloth or paper towel and place it over a large bowl. Pour the horchata mixture over the strainer. (Alternatively you can just use the strainer, but you might end up with some extra rice or almond bits in your drink.) Squeeze the almond/rice mixture with your hand to get every last bit of milky liquid out.	84
540	Throw out the pulpy almond/rice mixture. Now add the vanilla bean paste and 1/2 cup of brown rice syrup. Add the brown rice syrup, whisk it thoroughly, and taste it. If it needs more sweetening add more brown rice syrup. Once you're satisfied with the sweetness pour the Horchata into a jug and put it in the fridge. Serve it in ice filled glasses.	84
541	It will keep for a couple of days in the fridge, but not much longer. And honestly, if you can leave it for more than 2 days I will be shocked.	84
542	Heat the oven to 400 F.	85
543	Scrub the sweet potatoes and stab them with a fork a few times. Lay them on a baking sheet. Bake for 60 to 75 minutes. Because sweet potatoes vary greatly in size, check them after an hour by stabbing with a long knife. If it goes through easily, they're ready. If not, bake longer. Let cool for 15 minutes.	85
544	Make a long cut along the top of each potato and open them gently, beating with a fork to fluff up the soft, orange middle. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Let each person add sour cream and scallions (or more salt and pepper) to their taste.	85
546	To make the dressing, drop the egg yolk into a large mixing bowl. Add the lemon juice, mustard, garlic, and anchovy. Whisk briskly until the dressing is light and frothy. Slowly add the olive oil, whisking the whole time. Once everything is incorporated, add the salt and pepper, then adjust to your taste. I like it very lemony.	86
582	Now take one of the "cheek" pieces and make 4-5 vertical cuts all the way down. Do not slice through the peel, just slice through the mango flesh until you feel the peel. If you go a bit too far don't worry, it will be fine, but try not to cut through the peel. It should look like this when you are done.	90
584	Now, gently press on the outer layer of peel upward to turn the piece inside out and kind of pop the mango pieces out. This is a lovely way to serve mango so if you are cutting mango just to eat or to serve someone else in the future, just stop here! But we're not quite done for our parfait.	90
585	Now do the same with the other side and then gently slice off the little squares with your knife, getting as close to the peel as you can. Look at your nice little pile of mango! Now do it again with the 2nd mango! It gets pretty quick and a lot easier with practice, I swear!	90
586	Now, as the mango slicer, take your reward and bite off any leftover mango bits from the pit piece.	90
587	Mmmmm this is so good. Do I even need to make the rest of the recipe?	90
588	Gotta gnaw off every bit of the mango flesh!  Don't worry if it gets stuck in your teeth. You'll get it out ... eventually.	90
545	Start by making croutons. Let the butter melt or the oil get hot. Add the bread and toss gently until coated. Let the bread sit for 2 minutes, then flip the pieces over. Keep tossing and turning until the bread is brown all over. Add oil or butter as needed and sprinkle with salt and pepper. It is basically impossible, unless you are very patient (which I am not) to get every side of the cubes browned, so just get them generally looking good and toasty and then take them off the heat.	86
547	Cut the kale leaves to remove the large stem from the center or grab the bottom of the stem and pull the leaves up briskly from the bottom to remove the stem. (Lacinato kale, sometimes called Tuscan kale, has the easiest stems to remove.) Slice the leaves in half lengthwise, then cut into thin ribbons. Chopping the kale into small pieces disguises its tough texture.	86
548	Toss the kale in the bowl to coat it with dressing. Set aside for 10 minutes or leave in the fridge for a few hours. The kale will become tender as it marinates.	86
549	Before serving, toss in the croutons and top with Romano cheese.	86
550	Cut the cabbage in half lengthwise, then crosswise into 2-inch pieces, discarding the root end. Place in a large bowl, sprinkle with the salt, and toss with your hands until the cabbage is coated. Add enough cold water to just cover (about 12 cups), making sure the cabbage is submerged but it's okay of some leaves poke out.	87
551	Cover with plastic wrap or a baking sheet and let sit at room temperature at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours to get nice and salty and preserved.	87
552	Drain the cabbage, by pouring the cabbage into a colander and rinse with cold water to get the excess salt off. Gently squeeze out the excess liquid and transfer to a  bowl; set aside.	87
553	Place the remaining ingredients in a large bowl and stir to combine.	87
554	Add the cabbage and toss with your hands until evenly combined and the cabbage is thoroughly coated with the mixture.	87
555	Pack the mixture tightly into a clean 2-liter glass jar with a tight-fitting lid and seal the jar.	87
556	Let sit in a cool, dark place for 24 hours (the mixture may bubble). Open the jar to let the gases escape, then reseal and refrigerate at least 48 hours before eating (kimchi is best after fermenting about 1 week). Refrigerate for up to 1 month.	87
557	To prepare the lemongrass, start by peeling off any very dry layers and slicing off the very end of the stalk. Thinly slice the next 2 to 3 inches of the bottom of the stalk (enough for 2 tablespoons), then chop the slices up finely. You'll only use the bottom of the stalk, not the top. Use 1 tablespoon of chopped lemongrass in the marinade and save the other tablespoon for when you're cooking.	88
558	Mix the marinade ingredients together, then toss it with the chicken (or other protein) until thoroughly coated, either in a freezer bag or a large bowl. Leave the chicken to marinate in the fridge, still in the bag or bowl, for 2 to 3 hours or overnight.	88
559	Once the chicken has marinated, put some oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the remaining lemongrass and stir fry for 30 seconds or so. Add the shallot and cook for about a minute, until it starts to turn translucent. Then add the garlic and cook for another minute.	88
560	Turn up the heat to medium-high and add the chicken all at once along with the marinade sauce. Try to make sure all the chicken is touching the pan so it can get browned. Leave for about 2 minutes, until that side of the chicken is cooked and a little browned.	88
561	Flip the chicken and cook for another 2 minutes on the other side.	88
562	Add enough broth to almost cover the chicken in the pan. Cover with a lid and cook for about 5 minutes, until the sauce thickens and everything is cooked through.	88
563	Serve over rice (maybe fried rice) or in a wrap with cooked vegetables like green beans, pea pods, or carrots.	88
564	To prepare the squash, peel off the tough skin with a potato peeler. Cut the squash in half lengthwise with a sharp chef’s knife, then scoop out the seeds and gloop.(You can save the seeds for a tasty snack later, if you like: just clean the gloop off, then toast them.)	89
565	Next, slice off the stem and very bottom of the squash and throw them away. Take each half of the squash and place it face-down on a cutting board. Chop each into 1/2” slices, then turn each slice into cubes.	89
566	Put a large pot or Dutch oven on the stove on medium heat. Melt the butter and let the pot get hot. Add the onion, pepper, and garlic, then sauté for two minutes.	89
567	Add the cubed squash and spices and stir it all together. Put a lid on the pot and let it cook for another two minutes. Add the coconut milk and water and stir.	89
568	Bring the soup to a boil, then turn down the heat to low and let it cook for about 30 minutes, or until the squash is tender.	89
569	Once the squash is tender, taste the soup and add salt and pepper as needed. Soup usually needs a fair bit of salt, so be generous.	89
570	If you have an immersion blender, you can purée the soup in the pot. If you have a normal blender, wait until the soup has cooled before transferring it to the blender. Purée until smooth, then taste again and add any more salt and pepper it might need.	89
608	When you are ready to start assembling the pies, turn the oven to 400 F. Butter or oil 6 muffin cups.	94
609	Remove the dough for the crust from the fridge. Divide the dough into 6 pieces and roll each piece into a small ball.	94
610	Sprinkle the counter with flour and one at a time, roll out each piece of dough into circles approximately 5 to 6 inches across. Be sure to sprinkle more flour between each roll out to make sure the dough doesn't stick to the counter. The circles should not be perfect, just basically round with jagged edges. Rustic is the look here so don't worry about perfection.	94
611	Carefully the place the circles of dough into each muffin tin, gently pressing them down into the corners. Be sure to leave the crust edges hanging over the top edges of the tin. These will be the pie crusts.	94
612	Fill each pie dough lined tin with apple mixture and fold the edges of the dough over the top. You should still have some apple mixture poking out the top.	94
613	Whisk the egg in a small bowl and use a pastry brush to brush egg over the top of each mini pie.  (This step is optional. It just makes the tops more golden and pretty)	94
614	Bake for 30 minutes or until the tops are golden brown and the apples are gooey and bubbling.	94
615	Once they are cool enough to touch use a butter knife to gently unstick the edges of the pie from the tin and remove onto a plate for serving.	94
616	Dust them with a little powdered sugar for extra presentation points and serve!	94
692	Knead the dough on a floured countertop for 5 to 7 minutes. Once the dough is elastic and smooth, place it in a lightly oiled bowl covered with plastic wrap and let it rise until it doubles in volume. This should take about 60 to 90 minutes.	109
693	When the dough has risen, punch it down and form it into a short log, which will be easier to roll into a rectangle. Dust your countertop with flour to keep the dough from sticking. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a rectangle about 1/4" thick.	109
694	Brush the top of the dough with the melted butter for the topping, then sprinkle with the brown sugar and cinnamon. Roll it up lengthwise like a carpet. Gently cut the roll into 12 rolls being carefully not to press down too hard to squish them.	109
695	Place the rolls in a casserole dish or baking pan and cover with a moist tea towel or plastic wrap. Let them rise for 45 minutes to an hour, until they have increased in volume by half.	109
697	Bake the rolls for 15 to 20 minutes, until they are puffed up and golden. I like them a little gooier—that is, slightly undercooked—so I usually pull them out at 15 to 16 minutes. If you like your buns a little firmer, (or properly cooked!) leave them for the full 20.	109
698	If you are making the frosting, use an electric mixer to beat the cream cheese, butter, sugar, and cinnamon together until light and fluffy. It should take 5 to 7 minutes. Once the rolls are room temperature, slather them with frosting and enjoy!	109
572	To make the coconut cream open your can of coconut cream. Place a large sieve over a bowl and use a spoon to scoop the coconut cream into the sieve letting the thin, coconut milk fall through the sieve and settle in the bowl. The coconut milk will have settled on the bottom of the can and this is the simplest way to separate the cream from the milk. We just want the cream for this recipe! Alternatively you can just carefully scoop out your cream, making sure the milk doesn't mix in with the cream.	90
573	In a bowl add the coconut cream, honey and vanilla and whisk for 30 seconds or so until it is smooth and thick.	90
574	Now cut up the mangoes. Here's some detailed instructions below, but if you already know how to cut mangoes just skip to the end.	90
575	Get a sharp paring knife and a cutting board. Hopefully you have a ripe mango. You want it to have just a little give everywhere. Firm, but your fingers can still easily squish it a bit. If it has any super squishy bits then it is probably bruised or over-ripe so try to pick the ones that have pretty much the same firmness, with just a little give all over. A good mango should feel a lot like a ripe avocado if you are more used to choosing them.	90
576	There is a large pit in the centre that is very long, but not very wide so you don't want to cut through the middle like you would with a peach. Holding the mango at the tip, with the wider rounded parts facing out, cut one slice of the mango off, kind of like you are cutting a cheek off. See where I did it below. Now slice all the way down.	90
577	Now repeat on the other side. You'll end up with 3 pieces of mango: 2 "cheek" pieces that are all the delicious flesh and one flat piece with a big pit in the middle.	90
578	The pitted piece is the one on the bottom of the photo. See the white, slightly hairy bits peaking out? That is the pit!	90
579	The piece with the pit on it still has some delicious mango flesh on it and we want all of it. So peel the skin off it, losing as little of the flesh as you can. Don't use my technique here. It's terrible. This is the only way I could show you what I was doing with one hand. Looks pretty ridiculous!	90
580	Once you have it peeled, cut away at the flesh, using the pairing knife to feel when you get too close to the tough pit. Just cut off small hunks and don't worry about them looking pretty. Get as much off as you can. The riper it is the more mango you can cut away from the pit. You may find your hands getting juicy and slippery so be careful. But better to get into it and wait until the end to clean your hands because there is a lot more to come.	90
581	There ya go! Now, don't throw out the pit, you'll use it later.	90
583	Now cut horizontally using the same technique to make a little checkerboard with your mango.	90
700	While the butter chills, add the flour and salt to your food processor.	110
850	In another small bowl, combine the mayo, gochujang paste, and soy sauce and mix thoroughly.	136
851	Once the water is boiling, drop the stem pieces of broccoli into the pot and boil for 1 minute before adding the florets. Boil for another 3 minutes. Remove a piece of broccoli from the water. If it is tender enough that a fork goes through with no resistance you're done. If not, leave them to boil for another minute or two. When tender, pour the broccoli into a strainer and let it stand until it's cool enough to touch. Add salt to the broccoli to taste.	136
852	Assembly time! Split the brioche buns in half. Toast them in the toaster oven or under the broiler until light golden. Slather the bottom of the bun in a generous layer of the chili mayo. Top the bottom half with mozzarella and toast again until the mozzarella just begins to melt. Carefully place a layer of broccoli on top of the bottom bun. Sprinkle a few of the toasted garlic pieces on top and continue to add more broccoli until you have used it all up or you worry that your tower of broccoli will not hold. This is like jenga. Try to create a nest that will hold once you bite into the sandwich. Sprinkle with the remaining garlic chips. Slather the top bun half with the rest of the chili mayo and top the sandwich.	136
589	Okay, so now just take your mango and spoon a layer of it into each glass. Top it with some coconut cream and then add the rest of the mango. Then drizzle the rest of the coconut cream overtop aaaaaand you're done! Not much to this one, but it is soooooo delicious and quite rich from the coconut cream. Now pick someone you really love to share this with and enjoy!	90
590	Blend the mango and yogurt together (and the vanilla if using). If it's too thick to drink with a straw, add some milk to thin it out. A ripe and juicy mango combined with thin yogurt is often all you need, but if your yogurt is thicker you may need to thin it out. Be warned: if you make this for children, they will request it over and over.	91
591	Dice the tofu into whatever size dice you most prefer. I went with about 1/2 inch cubes. Transfer the tofu to a freezer bag or sealable container. Pour the soy sauce and rice vinegar over the cubes and let it marinate for 1 hour in the fridge or up to a day.	92
592	In a small pan on medium heat toast the peanuts until they are light brown. Shake the pan occasionally to brown on all sides. It should take about 5 minutes.	92
593	In a large bowl mix up the shredded cabbage, scallions, cilantro, mint, lime juice and sour cream. Sprinkle with a couple pinches of salt. Stir and taste. Add more salt or lime juice or herbs to your taste. Add the peanuts and taste. (If you are fast and organized you can make this slaw while the tofu cooks, otherwise do it before you start the tofu on the next step.	92
594	Heat the vegetable in a large pan on medium heat. Be ready with a lid to cover the pan because once you add the tofu it will splatter. Add the tofu to the pan and shake it to make sure the pieces are well distributed in the oil. Be careful of the splatter as the marinade meets the hot oil! Cover with a lid and let it sizzle for 2 to 3 minutes.	92
595	Check the tofu after 2 to 3 minutes and flip the pieces if they are looking brown on one side. Do the best you can to flip as many as possible, but don't worry too much about getting every single one. Continue to fry the tofu, flipping them every couple of minutes, until the tofu is brown on all sides or as close to that as possible.	92
596	Lastly, in a large pan, toast the corn tortillas one or more at a time until they are light brown in a couple of spots and bubbles form. This will warm them and make them more pliable.	92
597	On each plate assemble the tacos by placing 2 to 3 tortillas on each plate and piling them high first with cabbage slaw and then with tofu.	92
598	Turn your oven's broiler up to high.	93
599	Peel off the outer layers of the corn and clean off all the corn silk. Leave the green ends attached for a convenient handhold.	93
600	Place the cobs on a baking pan under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes, then rotate them and repeat until they're brown and toasty all the way around. The broiling shouldn't take more than 10 minutes total.	93
601	Working quickly, spread a tablespoon of mayonnaise over each cob, lightly coating every kernel. Next, sprinkle the cheese all over the corn. It should stick fairly easily to the mayonnaise, but you'll probably get a little messy coating them thoroughly.	93
602	Sprinkle chile powder over the corn, but not too heavy or it'll be gritty. Use any chile powder you like; ancho or cayenne are great.	93
603	Lastly, squeeze lime juice all over and serve hot!	93
699	Cut the stick of butter into small chunks, approximately 8 to 12 pieces. Set them in a small bowl in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes.	110
701	Add the butter to the flour mixture in the food processor. Pulse the mixture 3 to 4 times until the butter pieces are chopped up into bean sized chunks.	110
604	Freeze the butter for 15 to 30 minutes.	94
605	Add the flour and salt to a large bowl. Remove the butter from the freezer and grate it into the flour mixture using the large side of a box grater. Gently massage the butter into the flour with your fingers until it's crumbly but still clumpy. Add half of cold water and gently bring the mixture together. Add the rest of the water and bring it together into a rough dough. Do not overmix, the dough does not need to be smooth and perfect, just mixed enough to hold together. Shape the dough into a rough disc, wrap it in plastic wrap and leave in the fridge for 1 hour.	94
606	Chop up the apples whatever way you prefer, but keep in mind that they need to be small enough to fit easily into your muffin tins so I cube the apples. Cut them in half and remove the core and stem. Then slice each half into 6 to 8 pieces lengthwise and then into 4 to 6 pieces widthwise.	94
607	Scoop the apple pieces into a bowl and add the brown sugar, cinnamon, corn starch, lemon juice and zest. Mix them up and set aside.	94
702	Add 4 tablespoons of water and pulse again. Add water a tablespoon at a time, pulsing as little as possible in between until the mixture looks like it is just able to come together. It should be very shaggy and chunky. You want to have bits of butter popping throughout the pastry—that's what creates flakiness.	110
703	Dump the mixture out onto a clean countertop and bring it together into a rough disc shape using your hands. Cover it with plastic wrap and leave it in the fridge for an hour.	110
704	After an hour, remove the dough from the fridge and let it rest on the counter for 5 minutes so you can roll it out more easily.	110
320	Heat the oven to 350 °F.	99
631	Butter or oil an 8” x 11” baking pan. If you have a different size pan, that’s fine—it’ll just change how thick the bars are.	99
632	Pour the oats into a large bowl. You can use quick oats\r\nif they’re all you have, but I prefer the bite and chew of rolled oats. For a different texture, you can also substitute a cup of oats with a cup of Rice Krispies, but\r\nthe bars are great either way.	99
633	Add the peanut butter, half the jelly, the water, and the salt to a small pan. Stir over low heat until it’s smooth.	99
634	Mix the peanut butter and jelly concoction into the oats until all the oats are coated and you have a sticky mass.\r\nDump the mixture into the oiled pan and press it into an even layer. Spread the remaining jelly over the top.	99
635	Pop the pan into the oven for 25 minutes, until it’s toasty and brown around the edges. Mmm. Crunchy.	99
636	Leave the bars in the pan until they cool completely, about an hour, then slice into 12 bars.	99
637	To make the peanut sauce, add oil to a saucepan on medium heat. Once it's warm add the jalapeno, garlic and shallot. Saute until everything's translucent. Add the turmeric and coconut milk. Let it come to a boil.	100
638	Turn the heat down and add your peanut butter, soy sauce and brown sugar and stir to combine. If the mixture is too thick, add a bit more coconut milk (try to use more of the thin milky part of the coconut milk rather than the solid fat) or water to it and stir until it is loose and pourable. Taste it to see if it needs more salt or sweet and add more as needed. You can add a bit of chile sauce to it if you like is spicier or if you want it to be more red like in most restaurants. Once you are happy with the flavor set it aside.	100
639	Put a large pot of water on to boil over high heat. Salt the water and put a lid on the pot. While the water comes to a boil chop your broccoli.	100
640	When the water comes to boil add noodles and cook according to package instructions. Place a sieve above the water and fill it with the broccoli. This is the sneaky way to steam things! Cover the pot and sieve with a lid. Allow the broccoli to steam for 2-3 minutes, until bright green. Remove the sieve of broccoli.	100
641	Place a pan on medium heat and add just enough oil to keep things from sticking. Add the broccoli and tofu. Stir-fry gently until the noodles are ready. Once the noodles are cooked, drain all but about 1/2 cup of water and dump the noodles and water into the pan with the tofu and broccoli. Add your peanut sauce and use tongs to swirl, and mix everything together in the pan. Add more water if you need it. It may get a little gummy and you don't want the noodles to stick together too much.	100
642	Squeeze lime juice all over the dish and taste. Add salt and pepper as needed and serve it up.	100
643	Splash the vegetable oil in a saucepan on medium heat. Once it’s warm, add the chili, garlic, and shallot and sauté until everything’s translucent. Add the turmeric (if using), coconut milk or water, and chile paste if using instead of fresh chile.	101
644	Let it come just to a boil, then turn the heat down. Add the peanut butter and soy sauce and stir to\r\ncombine. It should thicken quite a bit. If the oil is separating from the sauce a bit (this can happen from the oil in the coconut milk and the peanut butter, but it's easy to fix!), add water a few drops at a time and whisk until it comes smoothly back together. Once it’s all combined, taste it and add whatever you think it needs—but think about the salt and spice in particular.	101
705	Sprinkle a clean counter liberally with flour. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough straight in front of you. Once you have rolled a couple of times, pick up the dough and flip it over. Then rotate the dough 90 degrees. Roll out the dough another couple of times. Flipping it and rotating it will keep it from sticking to the countertop and help you make an even circle. Sprinkle more flour onto the counter if anything gets sticky. Don't be shy with the flour! Repeat this process until you have a large enough circle of dough to fit your pie plate, with some excess. You want to have pastry that is hanging over the edge of the pie plate, because it helps create a nice edge and lets you fix any mistakes you make.	110
706	Transfer the dough to a 9 inch pie plate and press it gently in place. You want about an inch of excess pastry hanging all the way around the rim. Trim away any pieces that are longer. Use your fingers in a pinching motion to roll excess dough up to create an edge on the lip of the pie plate. Squish this down with your fingers or a fork to create a rim around the lip of the pie. Alternatively, use a pinching motion to crimp the edge.	110
707	Prick the pie dough all over with a fork—this lets the air out while it bakes and helps to keep it from shrinking too much. Now cover the whole pastry with aluminum foil, pressing all around to cover the edges as well. Now pour dried beans (or some people use pennies) into the aluminum foil covered crust. These will weight the crust down and allow it to cook evenly without puffing up and shrinking.	110
708	Bake the crust with the dried beans for 15 minutes. This is called blind-baking. It's a useful method when pie filling has a shorter cooking time than the crust, as is the case here.	110
709	While the crust bakes, add all the ingredients for the filling to a large bowl and whisk it together until it is smooth and homogenous, being particularly careful to blend the eggs fully into the mixture.	110
710	Remove the blind-baked crust from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before removing the pie weights. Turn the oven temperature down to 400 F. Remove the aluminum foil carefully and prick the crust all over with a fork again.	110
711	Whisk the egg yolk in a small bowl. Use a pastry brush to gently brush the yolk all over the par-baked crust. Bake the crust for 5 more minutes. This step creates a moisture barrier between the crust and the pie filling, further ensuring that your crust will be crisp, even on the bottom of the pie.	110
712	After 5 minutes, pull the crust out of the oven and pour in the pie filling. Very carefully place the pie back in the oven and bake for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes check to see if the center is still jiggly by gently shaking the pie back and forth. If it doesn't move too much in the middle it's ready, if it still jiggles, give it up to 15 more minutes in the oven.	110
716	In a medium or large cast iron skillet melt the butter on medium heat. Add the onion and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the green chilies and tomatoes, stir, and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, just until some of the water cooks off.	111
717	Sprinkle the cornstarch all over your vegetables and stir until you don't see any white anywhere. Add the yogurt and stir. Now add your cheese and stir until it all melts together and is gooey and beautiful and colorful and amazing. Taste it and add any salt you think it needs. Often it doesn't need much or any since the cheese is pretty salty.	111
718	Sprinkle with chopped scallions and enjoy with lots of tortilla chips!!	111
719	Tip: This is also a great recipe to make in a slow cooker because you can keep it warm in there when you are serving it.	111
720	To make normal rice, pour 2 cups of water into a pot with 1 cup of uncooked rice and two pinches of salt. That’ll be enough for two generous portions, or three or four smaller servings. With the lid off, bring to a low boil over medium heat, then turn the heat down to low and put the lid on slightly askew, so that the steam can escape. Cook for about 20 minutes, until the water is all gone.	112
721	Stir the tomatoes with 1½ cups of water, then pour it into a pot with 1 cup of uncooked rice and two pinches of salt. Cook as above.	112
722	Stir the squash, pumpkin, or sweet potato with 1½ cups of water, then pour it into a pot with 1 cup of uncooked rice and two pinches of salt. (You can also use frozen, boiled, or sautéed squash.) Cook as above.	112
723	Chop up the spinach as much as you like. The more finely chopped, the more it will disperse into the rice. Cook normal rice, as above, for about 15 minutes, until most of the water is gone but not quite all. Mix the spinach into the rice. Cook with the lid off for the last 5 minutes. Adding the spinach at the end keeps it lush and bright, rather than the sad color of overcooked spinach.	112
724	Thoroughly clean the ramps. They are grown deep in the dirt and usually have some serious grit. Chop off the root ends and any particularly wilted or gnarly bits of leaf.	113
725	Chop the ramps roughly and transfer them to a food processor. Add the almonds and romano. Process for about a minute to break everything up. Add the olive oil a bit at a time while processing. Once the pesto is as smooth and runny as you prefer, stop adding olive oil and taste it. Add salt and pepper and taste again. Adjust anything else according to your taste, add more romano or salt as needed. Sometimes if it tastes a little flat you can add a squeeze of lemon to brighten it up.	113
726	If you don't have a food processor you can use a hand blender or you can chop it up by hand or with a mortar and pestle. Basically just finely chop and mash everything up. Chunky pestos are delicious!	113
727	Clean and chop your vegetables. Generally, I prefer to\r\nleave the skin on for the following reasons: skin tastes\r\nnice and gets crispy; there’s a lot of nutrition in the skin; peeling is slow! Just be sure to wash the vegetables\r\nthoroughly.	114
728	It’s up to you how you want to chop your vegetables.\r\nMany are nice roasted whole, like new potatoes or little\r\nsunchokes or turnips—they will be crispy and salty on\r\nthe outside and bursting with fluffy, starchy goodness\r\ninside. The general rule is that the smaller you chop things, the faster they cook, so try to keep everything\r\nabout the same size so nothing cooks faster than\r\nanything else.	114
729	Dump your vegetables into a roasting pan. Drizzle everything with olive oil or melted butter—about 2\r\ntablespoons per medium-sized roasting pan. Season\r\ngenerously with salt and pepper and add any other\r\nextras from the list at right. Use your hands to coat the\r\nvegetables thoroughly with the oil and spices.	114
730	If roasting root vegetables, pop the pan in the oven for 1 hour or longer, but check on the vegetables after 45 minutes. For non-roots they may be done after 20 to 30 minutes. Test them by poking them with a knife. If it meets no resistance, they’re finished; if not, let them cook longer. Don’t worry: it’s not much of a problem if you overcook them. Unlike vegetables overcooked through boiling or steaming, overcooked roasted vegetables may dry out a bit, but still retain their shape and flavor.	114
731	After you pull the vegetables out of the oven, push\r\nthem around with a spatula to free them from the pan.\r\nRemove any garlic cloves and smash them into a fine\r\npaste (removing the skins at this point), then put the\r\ngarlic back in the pan and mix together.	114
732	Squeeze the juice out of any lemons and discard the\r\nwoody bits of any cooked herbs. Add a little more\r\nbutter, a bit of favorite sauce, a little soft cheese or\r\nmayonnaise, and serve.	114
733	If you like raw onion, go right ahead and combine everything. Otherwise, take the edge off by sauteing the onion with a bit of water in a pan over medium heat. The onion is ready once the water has boiled off. If you aren't a fan of cilantro, substitute another herb: mint, savory, or lemon balm work well.	115
734	Mix the onion, tomato, and the rest of the ingredients in a bowl. Be sure to add enough salt and pepper!	115
735	Taste the salsa. You're looking for a balance of spicy from the peppers, sweet from the tomatoes, and bright and fresh from the herbs and lime juice. If something is out of balance, add the appropriate ingredient to bring it back into balance.	115
736	Store in an air-tight container in the fridge. Fresh salsa won't last as long as store-bought salsa because it doesn't have any preservatives, but it's so tasty that I'm sure you'll finish it fast!	115
737	Melt 1/2 tablespoon of butter in a small pan on medium heat. Place the two slices of bread in the pan and let them sizzle for about 2 minutes, then lift them with a spatula to check whether they're golden brown underneath. When they are, flip 'em over. Add another 1/2 Tbsp of the butter to the pan to make sure the second side of the toast becomes just as golden as the first. Sprinkle the top of the bread with salt and pepper. Once the second side is golden, set the bread on a plate to await its topping. Repeat if feeding 2.	116
738	To make the broccoli: Warm up the oil in a pan on medium heat. Add the garlic and chili flakes and cook for 2 minutes, until they smell great but are not yet brown. Add the anchovy and cook for another minute. Add the broccoli and about xbc cup of water. Cover the pan, steam for 3 minutes, then toss and cook for 2 minutes, until the broccoli is tender and the water is gone. Spoon onto toast; top with cheese, salt, and pepper!	116
739	Put the butter for the topping in the freezer for 30 minutes. Set the oven to 425 F.	117
740	Lightly oil an 8"x10" baking dish (or any baking dish that will accommodate the mixture) and pile in the vegetables, garlic, scallions, lemon zest, and basil (if using). Pour the olive oil, salt, and pepper over top and mix it up with your hands. Bake the vegetables for 25 minutes while you prepare the biscuit topping.	117
741	For the topping, measure out the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, pepper, paprika and cheese into a bowl. Mix it up!	117
742	Once the butter is frozen, use a box grater to flake the butter into the flour mixture. Gently massage the butter into the flour with your fingers until it's crumbly but still clumpy. Add the milk and quickly bring the dough together. Don't knead the dough: lumpiness is fine and results in flaky topping. Put it in the fridge until the vegetables come out of the oven.	117
743	Once the vegetable mixture has cooked for 25 minutes, quickly top it with small clumps of biscuit dough. The vegetables should still be visible in some areas.	117
744	Bake for 10 to 25 minutes or until the vegetables are bubbly and the topping is lightly browned. Top with some more cheddar and some chopped herbs, then enjoy!	117
745	In a small pan on medium low heat melt the butter or ghee.	118
746	Add the cumin seeds and wait until the sizzle. Stir them around the pan and add the onion. Sprinkle a pinch of salt on the onions then stir to coat in the butter. Cook until the onion just becomes translucent.	118
747	Add the garlic, jalapeño (this is optional and makes the dish pleasantly spicy. If you don't want it too hot just use a small amount or skip it entirely) and tomato and stir. Let it cook for another 5 minutes or so until some of the juices have cooked up and the onions are starting to darken.	118
748	Add the ginger, turmeric and coriander and another sprinkling of salt and stir. Taste and add more salt if you think it needs it.	118
749	In a small bowl whisk the eggs with a fork just to break up the yolks. Add another sprinkling of salt to the eggs.	118
750	Turn the heat down to low and add the eggs into the pan all at once, gently stirring the eggs and vegetables together using a spatula or wooden spoon. Continue until the eggs are still soft and creamy, but fully cooked.	118
751	Turn off the heat and add a sprinkling of cilantro to taste and stir. Spoon onto plates with fresh roti or flat bread or just toast if that's what you have. Sprinkle a little more cilantro and enjoy.	118
752	Lightly crush the sprigs of mint in your hand to bruise them and let a little more of their flavor infuse into the drink. Drop them into a tall glass. Drop the lemon and/or lime slices in the same glass. Top with seltzer.	119
753	Bring the stock to a boil in a medium-sized pot, then turn the heat down to low and slowly pour in the cornmeal while stirring briskly with a wooden spoon.\r\nStirring while pouring is crucial to keep the grits\r\ncreamy and smooth—no lumps! Once the grits become\r\nsmooth and thick, place a lid on the pot with the spoon\r\nstill in it so that steam can escape.	120
754	Let the grits cook while you prepare the rest of the\r\nmeal, checking in occasionally to give them a stir. The\r\ntotal cooking time should be about 25 to 30 minutes.	120
755	Meanwhile, prepare the shrimp and vegetables. Add the\r\nbutter or oil to a large pan on medium heat and let it\r\nget hot. Add the onion, pepper, and celery. Sauté until\r\nthe onion is just translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the\r\ngarlic, as well as the green chile if you like things spicy.\r\nLet everything cook for another minute. Add the tomato\r\nand cook for 3 or 4 minutes, until the tomato releases\r\nits juice and the vegetables resemble a thick and chunky sauce.	120
756	Add a dribble of water to keep everything loose and saucy, then toss in the shrimp. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are pink all over. Add salt and pepper to taste.	120
757	Once the grits are ready, take them off the heat and add\r\nthe cheese and most of the scallions, then stir. Ladle the\r\ngrits into bowls and top with the shrimp, vegetables,\r\nand a few more scallions.	120
758	Melt 4 Tbsp of butter in a small bowl in the microwave for 30 seconds.	121
759	Grate the garlic using the most finely grained grater you have (I used my microplane of course!). Add the garlic to the butter and stir. Set aside.	121
760	In a pan on medium heat, melt the last tablespoon of butter. Add half the frozen shrimp to the pan, sprinkle with a little salt and cook undisturbed for 3 minutes. It should release quite a bit of water. After 3 minutes they should be pink on one side and maybe beginning to be pink all the way through. Flip the shrimp over and cook for another 2 minutes, just until they are pink all over and curled up. Taste and add more salt if needed. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, remove the shrimp from the pan into a bowl. Keep the pan on the heat with the leftover butter and shrimp juice and add the rest of the shrimp and cook in the same way as the first batch. Remove to the bowl to cool.	121
761	Keep the pan on medium heat and don’t clean it out. You want the shrimp juices and butter! Add the corn, bell pepper, and jalapeño (if using) to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally for 3 to 5 minutes, just until warm and the vegetables are tender. Add the white parts of the scallions into the pan for the last minute or so of cooking. Turn off the heat and leave everything in the pan.	121
762	Wait until the shrimp is cool enough to touch (hopefully it should be cool enough since it’s been sitting while you cook the vegetables). Pull off the tails of the shrimp, making sure to not leave behind too much delicious tail meat. Toss the tails.	121
763	Now, you can use the shrimp whole or chop them up a bit. I like to chop them into about 3 pieces per shrimp so that they are a bit easier to spread on the bun and so they are closer to the size of the vegetables. But if you want big chunks that is totally up to you. Do what you like best.	121
764	Add the de-tailed (winky face) shrimp back into the pan and sprinkle salt and pepper over everything. Cook for about a minute until warm. Turn off the heat and scrape everything in the pan into a large bowl. Add the green parts of the scallions and the dill and lemon juice. Stir. Taste and adjust with salt, pepper, dill or scallions as you like.	121
765	Now, you can let the shrimp salad rest in the fridge until you are ready to eat, but I like it a little warm so I try to work quickly with preparing my buns after I get it off the heat. Up to you if you like it warm or cold though.	121
766	For the buns, turn on the broiler. Brush the inside of your hot dog buns with the garlic butter generously. It’s traditional to use the New England style buns that have the slit in the top instead of the side, but a side slit will not hurt you. Lay the buns open and as flat as possible on a baking tray under the broiler. Watch carefully until the buns are just beginning to brown. Be careful not to burn them! Get them as toasty as you like.	121
767	Heap each bun with shrimp salad and serve! Feel free to drizzle a little leftover garlic butter overtop for extra decadence.	121
768	Use the side of a knife to crush the garlic clove until it cracks open. Add all of the ingredients to a small pot.	122
769	Warm the mixture over low heat for about 10 minutes, until it starts to bubble gently and you can hear a bit of a sizzle, then turn off the heat. You want to heat it just enough to let the spices infuse into the oil, without getting so hot that the spices start to cook or fry.	122
770	Remove the pot from the stovetop and put it in the fridge with a lid. Let the spices infuse for 4 to 8 hours.	122
771	Taste the oil. If it isn’t strongly spicy, let it infuse for a few more hours. Once it’s ready, strain through a sieve to remove the spices.	122
772	Store in a jar in the fridge for up to a week.	122
773	Place eggs in a pot and cover with cold water (I'd recommend making more than 2 and having the others for snacks during the week) and bring to a boil on medium high heat. Once the the pot begins to boil, turn off the heat and cover the pot with a tight fitting lid.	123
774	Set a timer for three minutes. Once three minutes are up, pour out the hot water from the pot and run the eggs under cold water. Let them sit in the cool water for 10 minutes. 	123
775	To peel the eggs easily, roll the eggs around on a countertop, gently cracking them all over. Starting at the bottom of the egg gently but confidently peel the crackly shell. It should come off in one large piece, but of course that's not always the case.	123
776	Once they're peeled, carefully slice them in half and sprinkle them with a little salt and pepper.	123
780	Before serving, add the croutons and grate some romano over everything and toss. Then nestle the eggs into the top.	123
853	Bring milk, cream and salt to the point of just beginning to boil in a large, heavy bottomed pot. When just one bubble comes up to the top, add vinegar, give it a stir, and turn off the heat. The addition of vinegar should create a disturbance and the whey and cream begin to separate into curds and whey. (the magical part!)	137
854	While you wait, line a sieve with cheesecloth or two layers of paper towel and place over a large bowl.	137
855	Leave the mixture for 5 minutes, then stir to separate completely. There should be two distinct parts of the mixture, the cheesy chunk and the watery yellowish whey. If some of it is still milky, stir it a bit and then leave it to sit for a few more minutes.	137
856	Pour your ricotta mixture into the cheese-cloth-lined sieve with the bowl underneath to catch the whey. Leave for half an hour to drain. (You can save the whey to use in soups instead of broth.)	137
857	The cheese cloth will be full of a crumbly white cheese. That's your ricotta! Taste it and add more salt if you think it needs it, or add herbs or any spices you'd like to flavour it with.	137
858	Eat immediately, or pack it into an airtight container and store in the fridge.	137
859	Now spread it on your toasts and get creative with vegetable and fruit toppings like the ideas above!	137
866	Ricotta topped with sliced grapes.	137
777	For the salad, melt the butter in a large pan on medium heat until just sizzling. Add the bread cubes. Let them cook until brown on the underside, then flip them. Add more butter as needed to keep the bread nice and toasty. Cook until all sides are brown, but don't worry about them being perfect. While the croutons are still hot, sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Set aside.	123
778	To make the dressing, start with the egg yolk in a large mixing bowl. Add the lemon juice, mustard and hot sauce. Whisk briskly until it is light and frothy. Slowly add the olive oil, whisking the whole time. Once everything is incorporated, add the salt and pepper, then adjust to your taste. I tend to like it very lemony. Once you have made this once you won't need to measure, just eyeball everything.	123
779	Grab the tough spine of each piece of kale with one hand, then with the other hand clasp the bottom of the leaf and pull up quickly to remove the spine. If some of the spine is left in it's not a problem, but it is tough, so you want to get rid of most of it without sacrificing your tasty leaves. Slice the leaves in half lengthwise, then cut into thin ribbons. Cutting the leaves into thin ribbons will disguise its naturally tough texture. Add the kale to the bowl and toss to coat it with the dressing. Set aside for 10 minutes or leave in the fridge for a few hours. The kale will become more tender if it marinates in the dressing for a while.	123
781	In one bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, salt, nutmeg and cardamom.	124
782	In another bowl, use an electric mixer to cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the egg and mix for another minute. Add the vanilla and mix again.	124
783	Carefully add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix until you have a smooth, uniform dough.	124
784	Use your hands to form the dough into a long log. Wrap the dough log in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20 minutes or up to a day if you want to make cookies tomorrow.	124
785	When ready to bake, split the dough into 24 pieces. (Or more likely do it in batches of 12!) Roll each piece into a ball and place them, 6 at a time, onto a well greased or parchment-lined cookie pan. It's good to do just 6 per baking sheet because these guys will spread out a bunch and they need room. Bake for 10 minutes on the center rack. If you want to do 2 batches at once you can, but when you pull out the tray on the center rack, move the one on the top rack down and bake for one more minute. Continue until you have baked all the cookies.	124
786	Let the cookies cool on the pan once they come out of the oven for about 2 minutes. As you remove them, sprinkle them with a little bit of kosher salt, if using. They will seem gooey, but they will harden up as they cool. Once they are no longer too soft to move, place the cookies on a wire wrack to cool completely.	124
787	Eat right away or store in a sealed container.	124
788	Set oven to 400 F.	125
789	Chop the potatoes into bite-sized pieces and tumble into a baking dish. Try to keep the potatoes in one layer so they are all touching the bottom of the pan. Some overlap is okay, but if it is piled too high switch to a larger dish. One layer will allow for more even roasting and more crispy bits.	125
790	Melt the butter and pour all over the potatoes. Sprinkle the potatoes with salt and mix everything together with your hands. Roast for 40 minutes.	125
791	Lay your salmon fillets, skin-side down in another baking dish. Sprinkle each fillet with about 1/4 tsp salt. Melt the tsp butter (in the microwave is fine) and add it to a small bowl along with the soy sauce, garlic and sugar. Mix and pour the sauce overtop of the fillets and let sit while the potatoes roast.	125
792	Take the potatoes out of the oven and test their done-ness. If a fork goes through them easily they are good enough to eat. If they are not yet done put them back in the oven for another 5 minutes or as long as it takes.	125
793	Once the potatoes are cooked through place the salmon in the oven alongside them. (We still want the potatoes in a little longer to get crispy!) Bake the salmon for 5 minutes for rare salmon or 7 to 8 for completely cooked salmon.	125
794	Remove the salmon and potatoes from the oven and toss the scallions with the potatoes and mix well to coat everything in butter and scallions.	125
795	Dole out a generous pile of potatoes on each plate and top with a piece of salmon and a Tbsp chopped kimchi, if using. This makes a large helping of potatoes so you may have leftovers.	125
801	Remove the tofu from the pan and serve.	126
860	Ricotta topped with chopped, roasted brussels sprouts.	137
861	Ricotta topped with roasted cauliflower from Good and Cheap.	137
862	Ricotta topped with sliced, roasted carrots with black pepper.	137
863	Ricotta topped with Grated roasted beets and fresh dill (raw would work as well!)	137
864	Ricotta topped with clementine slices and a little honey. Looks weird, but this was way better than I expected. Any little oranges would work I'm sure!	137
865	Ricotta topped with chopped tomato. Not so seasonal, but I had some drab, out of season tomatoes leftover and this livened them up!	137
867	Ricotta topped with candied walnuts. Super good and very holiday. I made these by coating them with simple syrup, (equal parts water and sugar boiled until sugar dissolves), salt and a little cayenne pepper powder. Then spread them on a baking tray and baked at 350F for 10 minutes.	137
868	Note, before you begin. If you prefer your dressing on the very tart side, juice half the orange at first and taste. If you think it would be nice a little sweeter add more orange juice. I tend to like things sharp and sour, but this dressing is a bit sweeter and it's a nice change.	138
869	Set a sieve over a bowl and juice the orange, lime and lemon over it so that the sieve will catch any seeds.	138
870	Add about 1/3 cup olive oil, and a healthy sprinkling of salt and pepper to the bowl and whisk. Taste it and adjust with more salt and pepper or more olive oil if you think it needs it. Store in a sealed container or glass jar for a couple of weeks. Just be sure to shake it up to mix before using.	138
872	If you want a thicker sauce that will stick to pasta better, cook for 10 to 20 minutes to evaporate more of the liquid. Use immediately or keep in a jar in the fridge for later use.	139
797	Place the pieces in a large ziploc freezer bag or large tupperware and pour soy sauce over them. You don't need to completely cover them. Just use enough so it comes about half way up the edge of the container you're using. If you're using a bag you need even less. Just enough so that it's got something to marinate in. Press the air out of the bag and seal it. Shake it to make sure it's covered and leave the tofu for 1 hour to overnight. If using a tupperware you may want to flip the tofu over to give all sides a chance to marinate directly in the soy sauce.	126
798	Place a cast iron pan (or any other pan that can withstand higher heat) on medium high heat. Add some neutral cooking oil or ghee to coat the pan. Once the oil is hot add 6 to 8 slices of tofu to the pan facedown. Don't dry them off. You want the soy sauce to cook with the tofu and glaze it a bit as it cooks. Cover the pan with a splatter guard or lid. There will be splashing. Cook for 2 minutes without touching.	126
799	Remove the lid or splatter guard. If you're brave and don't mind a bit of splatter, spoon a small amount of leftover soy sauce onto each piece of tofu, then flip it over with your tongs. If you're nervous about the splatter you can just flip them. Cover again and leave for another 2 minutes.	126
800	Uncover the tofu and check on them. If they are already dark brown on both sides with crispy edges, take them off the heat. If they aren't dark enough for you, flip them again and apply more soy sauce. Be patient and don't disturb them. They need contact with the hot pan to get crispy and glazed and sticky.	126
802	With a layer of cheaty peanut sauce. Simply mix a big spoonful of peanut butter with a small spoonful of your favorite chile sauce. In my case it was the homemade Sriracha a friend brought me. Add a splash of water if it seems too thick. Of course you can just use peanut sauce from page 161 of Good and Cheap if you have some leftover.	126
803	With a layer of smashed peas with salt. There's a little smashed cashew on the top too. Very springy!	126
804	I know it seems weird, but soy sauce marinated tofu is a great bacon replacement. Here it is with lettuce and tomato. The tomatoes around here are still terrible, so I've used some leftover tomato sauce.	126
805	Bring the water and salt to a boil in a medium-sized pot, then turn the heat down to low and slowly pour in the polenta while stirring briskly with a wooden spoon. Stirring while pouring is crucial to keep the polenta creamy and smooth—no lumps! Once the cornmeal becomes smooth and thick, place a lid on the pot with the spoon still in it so that steam can escape.	127
806	Let the polenta cook while you prepare the rest of the meal, checking in occasionally to give it a stir. The total cooking time should be about 25 to 30 minutes, but if you're in a rush, you can eat it after 15, it just won't be as delicious.	127
807	Meanwhile, chop the spinach, garlic, and anchovy if you're using it. Set them aside. Add a bit of olive oil or butter to a pan on medium heat. Let the pan heat up until it sizzles when you flick it with water. Add the garlic, anchovy, and chile flakes. Let them cook until you can smell them, about 1 minute. Add the spinach and toss it around with a spoon or tongs, or just swirl the pan to coat the spinach with the garlic mixture. Let everything cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until the spinach is wilted. Remove the pan from the heat and move its contents to a bowl to wait for the polenta and eggs.	127
808	When the polenta is about 2 minutes from done, start with the eggs. Wipe the pan quickly with a cloth, then put it back on medium heat. Splash a bit more olive oil in the pan and wait for it to get hot. Crack the two eggs into the pan and cover with a lid. This will steam them, making sunny-side-up eggs with fully cooked whites.	127
809	Scoop the polenta into a pair of bowls. Add some Romano and lots of salt and pepper. Layer about half the vegetables over the polenta.	127
810	Once the whites of the eggs are cooked, remove the eggs from the pan with a spatula and lay them over the polenta and vegetables. Top with the rest of the vegetables and further sprinklings of cheese.	127
811	Turn on your broiler. Dump your green beans onto a cookie sheet and distribute them evenly. Sprinkle the coconut flakes over the top. Get the big coconut flakes, not the finely shaved kind. You want them to have lots of surface area to get brown.	128
812	Add the oil to a pan on medium heat and let it get warm. Add your shallots and jalapeno. If you don't want the dish to be too spicy remove the seeds and white membranes from the jalapeno before you slice it up.	128
813	Let the shallot and jalapeno cook for about 3 minutes until they begin to brown a bit. Add a bit of salt to the pan, turn down the heat and add about 1/4 cup water to get some of the brown stuff off the bottom of the pan. Keep cooking, stirring occasionally until the shallots are a deep brown. Add water as needed to unstick the pan.	128
814	Once the shallots and jalepenos are brown and caramelized, add the cumin seeds, lime zest, coconut milk and some more salt and pepper. Let it cook for about a minute just to let everything come together. Turn off the heat and add lime juice. Taste it and adjust the salt, pepper and lime juice as you see fit. Set it aside.	128
816	Take the beans out of the oven and shovel them into a large bowl. Cover them with the dressing and toss to coat. Serve warm.	128
898	In a pan on medium heat, melt the rest of the butter. Add the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds, just until the garlic smells good.	143
899	Turn up the heat to medium high and add the cauliflower and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 6 minutes. Let it get a little brown, with some crunchy bits.	143
900	Next add the farro, and toss. Cook for 2 minutes more just until the farro is warmed up. Add a bit of salt and taste to see if the cauliflower is soft enough for your taste. Add kale and the zest of the lemon. Stir to wilt the kale, it shouldn't take more than a minute.	143
901	Add a bit more salt and taste, if it’s a bit under-salted that is okay because you’ll get more saltiness from the goat cheese in a moment. If it tastes good, turn off the heat and add the goat cheese and a generous squeeze of lemon juice. Taste one more time and add more salt, lemon or goat cheese if you think it needs it. Serve warm.	143
243	When ready to use, line a strainer with cheese cloth and place it over a bowl. Pour the mixture into the bowl through the strainer. To get every last drop of the good stuff grab the cheese cloth and squeeze all the liquid out into the bowl.	144
903	Leave the jar for 2 to 4 weeks shaking it once each day or when you think of it.	144
817	Add the vegetable oil to a frying pan on medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the green beans. Let them cook undisturbed for about 1 minute.	129
818	Mix the garlic, soy sauce, and sambal oelek in a bowl (and the ginger and lemon juice, if using).	129
819	The beans should have turned bright green. Add\r\nabout ¼ cup of water to the pan. Cook another\r\n2 minutes, until the water is mostly gone. Pour\r\nthe sauce into the pan and toss gently to coat.\r\nCook another 2 minutes, until everything is fragrant and most of the liquid is gone. Poke the beans with a fork: if it goes through easily, they’re done. They should take about 5 minutes.	129
820	Taste and add more chili sauce or soy sauce if you want the beans hotter or saltier.	129
821	In a non-stick pan on medium heat let the butter or olive oil get hot. Add the potato, jalapeno and garlic. Let it cook for a minute without touching. Add the cumin powder and smoked paprika and toss gently to coat the vegetables. Let it cook for another minute.	130
822	Add the black beans and salt and pepper. Let it cook just to get warm for another two minutes. Taste and adjust the salt and pepper and spices to your taste. Take the pan off the heat.	130
823	Place 4 small or two large tortillas on two plates. Pile the filling evenly onto one half of the tortilla. Sprinkle a bit of cheddar cheese on top if using. Now, with the filling side facing you, fold the left and right sides of the tortilla over the filling and then, working from the side closest to you, gently roll the tortilla over to create a tight roll.	130
824	Slice it in half and serve it with salsa on the side and cilantro leaves sprinkled on top.	130
825	Turn your oven's broiler to high.	131
826	Mix the spices together in a small bowl. Sprinkle them over both sides of the fish and massage gently with your fingers to cover thoroughly in the spices.	131
827	Lay the fish on a baking pan lined with aluminum foil.	131
828	Broil for 4 to 7 minutes. The fish will cook very quickly, so after 4 minutes, check to see if they are done by gently inserting a butter knife into the thickest part. If it goes through easily and the fish flakes apart, you're done. If the knife meets resistance and the fish stays together, put the fillets back under the broiler for another few minutes. Once you've done this once or twice, you'll be able to tell when your fish is done at a glance.	131
829	When the fish is done, squeeze lime juice all over it. Serve with rice or a favorite side dish like spicy green beans	131
830	Slice off the woody ends of the asparagus. Cut the asparagus diagonally into lots of small pieces. You can cut a few stalks at a time.	132
831	Toss the asparagus into a bowl and add the greens.	132
832	In a small bowl add the chimichurri (make your own!), olive oil, lime juice and water and mix together. Taste it and add a little salt and pepper if you think it needs it.	132
833	Pour the dressing over the greens and mix together with your hands so everything is coated. Serve immediately.	132
834	If you're using field cucumbers (usually much less expensive than English cucumbers) peel them roughly to remove the tough skin.	133
835	If your bread is still pretty soft, toast is a bit so it's crisp. This will help it absorb the juices from the dressing and the strawberries. Oddly enough, using fresh bread for this will just not work as well. You really do want the old, hard stuff!	133
836	Mix up the dressing in a large salad bowl.	133
837	Throw the cucumbers, strawberries and bread cubes into the bowl with the dressing. Toss everything to coat and to mingle with the strawberry juices. Let the salad sit for about 10 minutes to let the bread soak up the juices. Taste it and add more salt or lemon juice according to your taste.	133
838	You can add a sprinkling of sugar if you want to bring out the sweetness in the salad. Add finely chopped basil or mint leaves if you have them.	133
839	Turn oven to 400 F.	134
840	Melt the butter in a pan on medium heat. Add the onion and jalapeno and cook for three minutes or until they become translucent. Add the tomatoes and black beans and cook until heated through. Add the sour cream and cheddar cheese. Stir to combine and taste. Adjust with salt and pepper.	134
841	Slice each green chile in half. Carefully cut out the seeds and placenta and get rid of the stems.	134
842	Place the chile halves facing upward in a greased baking dish. Fill each chile with the black bean filling. Bake for 30 minutes.	134
843	Top with chopped avocado, sour cream and cilantro and serve!	134
844	Mix up the dressing and taste it. Adjust the salt, pepper, and lime to your liking.	135
845	Mix the other ingredients in a large bowl. Pour the dressing over just before serving and toss to coat the salad evenly.	135
846	Eat immediately, maybe with a few extra tortilla chips on the side. If you'd like some salsa with your salad, make your own!	135
847	Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.	136
848	While you wait for the water to boil, place a small pan on medium heat and melt the butter.	136
849	Fry the garlic in the butter until dark brown and crispy. Take them off the heat and put them in a small bowl. Mmmmm garlic chips.	136
871	Add the olive oil to a saucepan on medium heat. Sauté the garlic for 1 minute, until it smells great and becomes translucent. Add the chili flakes and cook for 30 seconds. Add the can of tomatoes, mix, and cook until warmed through. Add a little lemon zest, then salt and pepper to taste. Since canned tomatoes are often already salted, you may not need to add any.	139
873	Start with the oil in a large high-sided saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, pepper, and celery, then cook for about 5 minutes, until they become translucent but not brown.	140
874	Add the rest of the ingredients except for the rice and broth. Let everything cook for about 1 minute to let some of the tomato juice release.	140
875	Add the rice and slowly pour in the broth. Reduce the heat to medium and let the dish cook until the rice absorbs all the liquid. It should take about 20 to 25 minutes.	140
876	If you're using any of the additions, throw them in at about the 15-minute mark to let them warm up.	140
877	Set the oven to 400 F.	141
878	There are two ways to make this quiche. If you have a cast-iron or other oven-proof skillet, you can make the quiche right in the skillet. This cuts down on dishes. Otherwise, start with a regular skillet and later transfer everything to a pie plate to bake.	141
879	Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add your onion slices and sprinkle a bit of salt and pepper over them. Cook the onions until they are golden brown and starting to caramelize. If your pan is oven-proof, simply remove it from the heat and spread the onions evenly across the bottom. Otherwise, butter a pie plate and scoop the onions into it, creating an even layer on the bottom. The onions add a crust-like texture and a bit of crunch.	141
880	A note on vegetables: For things like broccoli, cauliflower or winter squash, I suggest steaming or cooking them before adding them to the quiche to ensure they'll be fully cooked. For tomatoes, zucchini, spinach or any other quick-cooking vegetable, just use them fresh.	141
881	Spread the vegetables evenly over top of the onions. The dish or pan should look fairly full.	141
882	In a bowl, use a fork to lightly beat the eggs with the milk, cheese, salt, and pepper, just enough to break up the yolks and whites. This is a savory custard mixture. Pour the custard over the vegetables and onions and enjoy watching it fill in all the free spaces.	141
883	Bake the quiche in the oven for 1 hour. Once the surface is lightly brown all the way across, it's fully cooked.	141
884	Let the quiche cool for about 20 minutes, then slice into wedges and serve with a side salad.	141
885	Turn your oven to 350 °F.	142
886	Using the paper wrapping from the butter, lightly\r\nbutter an 8” x 11” glass baking dish or 9” springform\r\npan. Any shape will do so long as it is large enough. This cake doubles in size when it bakes.	142
887	In a large bowl, mix the pear slices and lemon juice together with your hands, making sure the pears are well coated in juice.	142
888	In a medium bowl, stir the flour with the baking\r\npowder and nutmeg, getting rid of any lumps.	142
889	In another large bowl, beat the butter, brown sugar,\r\nand salt, either with a wooden spoon or an electric\r\nmixer. Stop when the mixture is fluffy and has slightly\r\nlightened in color. Add the vanilla, then the eggs one at a time, fully mixing in the first egg before adding the second.	142
890	If using an electric mixer, switch to a wooden spoon\r\nand add the flour mixture into the butter mixture,\r\ngently incorporating it until it’s smooth. The batter will\r\nbe quite thick.	142
891	Spread half the batter over the bottom of the buttered\r\npan. Evenly distribute 16 of the pear slices over top.\r\n(There should be 32 in total.) Spread the other half of\r\nthe batter over the peaches, then top with the remaining\r\npear slices, perhaps creating a pattern if you feel like it. Sprinkle with a tablespoon or so of sugar and place the cake in the oven.	142
892	Bake for 1 hour or until a knife inserted into the center\r\ncomes out clean. Let it cool for about a half hour, but it is delicious if eaten while still warm.	142
893	Rinse the farro in a sieve in the sink.	143
894	In a medium-size pot bring the farro, water and salt to a boil on medium heat.	143
895	While the farro cooks, chop your vegetables and get everything ready so you can make the salad quickly once the farro is ready.	143
896	Once the farro is boiling, turn the heat down to low and place a lid on just slightly askew so some steam can escape. Cook for approximately 30 minutes. Check after 25 minutes and add a bit more water if the pot looks too dry.	143
897	Once 30 minutes has passed, taste one of the farro grains and see if it is soft enough to eat but still with a little chew, kind of like good pasta is cooked al dente. If it’s cooked enough, take the farro from the heat and drain any excess water. Add one Tbsp of butter to the top and let it melt and mix in. Put a lid on the pot so it stays warm while you continue with the rest of the meal.	143
902	In a mortar and pestle pound all the spices and your vanilla bean just enough to break them up and release their aromas. Pour them into a jar with a tight fitting lid, a canning jar is best. Pour the alcohol over the spices and seal the jar.	144
904	Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. The water should taste like salty seawater. This is how the pasta is seasoned so don't be shy on the salt.	145
905	When the water is boiling, cook the pasta to al dente according to the package instructions. In my case it took 6 minutes. Finally, drain the pasta before adding to the sauce. (While you wait for the water to boil get on with the rest of the recipe by following the instructions below, but keep an eye on the water.)	145
906	In a medium-sized pot melt 2 Tbsp of butter on medium heat. Add the flour and whisk briskly to combine the butter and flour and create a roux which will thicken the sauce. Cook for about 30 seconds.	145
907	If you are not a huge beer and cheese fan or you are unsure about the strong taste, use the half beer, half milk variation. If you know you love beer and cheddar together do the all-beer version.	145
908	Slowly pour in the beer (or milk and beer mixture) about a half a cup at a time, whisking to incorporate the roux. It will look thick and pasty at first but thin out once you add all the beer.	145
909	Whisk in the mustard and the Worcestershire sauce and cayenne if using. Let the mixture heat until it just starts to boil. The sauce should be thick and beery smelling and dark.	145
910	Turn the heat to the lowest possible setting and add in the cheese. Whisk until it is all melted and incorporated into a smooth, gooey sauce. Turn the heat off and put a lid on the sauce while you finish up the recipe. (Check on the pasta water at this point and start cooking the pasta if you haven't yet).	145
911	In a pan on medium heat melt the last Tbsp of butter. Add the broccoli stem pieces and cook for 2 minutes, tossing occasionally. Add the broccoli crown pieces and salt and cook, tossing now and then, for about 4 minutes, or until just tender. Taste and add more salt if you think it needs it.	145
912	To assemble the final dish, turn the heat in the sauce pot to low and add the drained pasta and broccoli. Using a wooden spoon or serving spoon mix everything together to coat it. Heap into bowls and serve.	145
913	In a large bowl or stand mixer add the whipping cream, sugar, and vanilla. Whip with a whisk or electric beaters or stand mixer until soft peaks form in your whipped cream. Give it a few more whisks just to make sure it's at the stiff, yet still pourable consistency of properly whipped cream. Do not over-mix or you'll end up with sweet butter, which is not what we're going for here.	146
914	If using fresh fruit, simply chop it up into bite-sized pieces, or if using smaller berries you probably don't need to do anything to them.	146
915	If using frozen fruit, either thaw at room temperature until the fruit no longer has ice crystals clinging to the outside, but still holds it's form. Or you can microwave the fruit for a short time, maybe a minute or so, to defrost faster.	146
916	Pile about 1/2 cup of fruit into each bowl or glass. Add about 1/4 cup of whipped cream into each glass and either leave in as is or mix it together as I did in the photographs above. ENJOY!	146
917	Cover the potatoes with cold water in a pot and let it come to a boil on high heat. Once it’s boiling turn the heat down to medium and let the potatoes simmer for 10 minutes	147
918	Sprinkle the fish fillets with salt and pepper and set aside.	147
919	Drain the potatoes, let them cool for a minute, then slice them into bite-size pieces, keeping any smaller pieces whole. Throw them into a bowl and toss them with 2 Tbsp of olive oil, and lots of salt and pepper. Don't wash this bowl! You'll use it once the potatoes come back out of the oven.	147
920	Turn your broiler on high.	147
921	Line a baking tray with parchment paper and arrange the fish fillets on it. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil. Now pour the potatoes onto the tray, filling in the areas around the fish. It should all be able to share a tray.	147
922	Broil the fish and potatoes on the oven shelf one down from the top for 8 to 15 minutes. The time will depend on how big your fillets are so consider it. I used tilapia that were quite thin, but I cooked them from frozen, so they were perfect after 10 minutes. So just keep an eye on them. They are done when they flake apart when you apply gentle pressure with your finger.	147
923	While the fish and potatoes bake, make the chimichurri sauce! Add the rest of the ingredients except for the water to a food processor and blitz until you have a smooth paste. Keep blitzing the sauce and drizzle the water into it until it becomes a thick, yet pourable puree. Taste and add more lime juice and salt to your taste.	147
924	Remove the fish and potatoes from the oven. Toss the potatoes back into the bowl you mixed them in before and add a few spoonfuls of chimichurri. Toss and coat!	147
925	Drizzle copious amounts of chimichurri sauce all over the fish and serve.	147
926	Place the butter in the freezer for 30 minutes.	148
927	Turn the oven to 400 F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, or lightly grease the pan if you don't have the paper.	148
928	In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt.	148
929	Prepare your jalapeno and cheese. Cutting the cheese into cubes rather than grating it means you'll have pockets of gooey cheese that contrast nicely with the scone. If you want the spice of the jalapeno, leave the seeds and membrane; if you like it milder, remove them and chop up only the pepper itself.	148
930	Remove the butter from the freezer and grate it directly into the flour mixture. (Use a cheese grater it's the best way to break up butter without melting it.) Using your hands, gently squish the butter into the flour until everything is incorporated but not smooth. The chunks of butter will create flaky scones. Add the jalapeno, cheese, eggs, and milk to the bowl, then use your hands to gently mix everything until it just comes together. It will probably be a little shaggy, but that's just fine.	148
931	Sprinkle flour on a clean countertop and dump the dough onto it. Gently shape the dough into a disc about 1 1/2 inches thick. Cut the dough into six triangles, like a pizza, and move them to the cookie sheet.	148
932	In a small bowl, gently beat the egg for the egg wash. Brush it over the scones, then sprinkle salt and pepper over each one. Bake for 25 minutes or until the scones are golden brown.	148
933	Place a layer of eggs at the bottom of a pot that is large enough to fit them with a bit of wiggle room. If you can’t fit all your eggs, don’t stack them—they might crack. Split them into batches instead.	154
934	Cover the eggs with cold water. Bring the pot to a boil over medium heat without a lid. As soon as the water is boiling, turn off the heat and cover the pot with a tight lid. Set a timer for 10 minutes.	154
935	When the timer goes off, gently pour out the hot water and cover the eggs with very cold water. The cold water stops the cooking process so that you don't end up with that slightly icky blue-green skin around your yolk.	154
936	Peel the eggs. Everyone has their own technique, but I like to gently roll each egg across the counter to crack the shell. Roll the egg around until it looks like a cracked desert landscape, then peel it starting from the bottom. Once peeled, rinse the egg and set it aside. Repeat until you have peeled all the eggs.	154
937	Slice each egg in half lengthwise. Pop the yolks out and put them in a medium bowl. Don't worry if you leave a little yolk behind. Set the whites aside on a plate.	154
938	Sprinkle the yolks with salt and pepper, add the ingredients to the bowl. Mash with a fork and mix until it becomes a relatively smooth paste.	154
939	Arrange the whites on a plate and spoon the yolk mixture back into each hole. Pile the filling high! Alternatively, scoop the filling into a plastic sandwich bag. Cut off the corner of the sandwich bag and squeeze the yolk mixture into the whites.	154
940	Sprinkle with the scallions and some paprika for color. Have a great party!	154
